					Every creature in the crowd<br />
					Make some noise and make it loud<br />
					Introducing tonight's special guest<br />
					It's Shelly the Android Lobster!<br />
					<br />
					[Shelly sings!]<br />
					<br />
					'Cuz you can choose the way<br />
					You walk<br />
					When you're heart's in the<br />
					Right place<br />
					<br />
					In Creature City<br />
					Be who you're meant to be<br />
					In Creature City<br />
					Set sail on the starry seas <br />
					<br />
					Alright<br />
					Repeat after me<br />
					One, two, three!<br />
					<br />
					I'll be what I want to be<br />
					(I'll be what I want to be)<br />
					<br />
					Yeah<br />
					Down in Creature City<br />
					Sing it!<br />
					(Down in Creature City)<br />
					<br />
					The music never stops, no<br />
					<br />
					[Shelly sings!]<br />
					Sing it Shelly!<br />
					<br />
					(You know how we do it)<br />
					<br />
					(Life)<br />
					<br />
					(In a single night, the whole world had been reborn)<br />
					[The Wolves howl]<br />

					You walk<br />
					When you're heart's in the<br />
					Right place<br />

				<h3>4/29/24 - 6/24/24</h3>

				<div class="songs">
					<b>lyrics</b>
					<br />
					We are living our lives<br />
					Abound with so much information<br />
					Come on, let go of the remote<br />
					Don't you know you're letting all the junk flood in?<br />
					I try to stop the flow, double-clicking on the go<br />
					But it's no use, hey, I'm being consumed<br />
					Loading, loading, loading<br />
					Quickly reaching maximum capacity<br />
					Warning, warning, warning<br />
					Gonna short-circuit my identity (ah)<br />
					Get up on your feet, tear down the walls<br />
					Catch a glimpse of the hollow world<br />
					Snooping 'round town will get you nowhere<br />
					You're locked up in your mind<br />
					<mark>
						We're all trapped in a maze of relationships<br />
						Life goes on with or without you<br />
						I swim in the sea of the unconscious<br />
						I search for your heart, pursuing my true self<br />
					</mark>
					Get up, get up, it's time to get real<br />
					Can't control the steering wheel, outside is in a veil of mystery<br />
					Won't get out so easily<br />
					We are living our lives, and we realize what's happening<br />
					Hey, brother, watch yourself<br />
					Grab your things, don't miss your chance<br />
					Find your own rhythm<br />
					And dance your own dance<br />
					Be creative, chart your course<br />
					You must know what lies ahead<br />
					Driving through the deep end of the ocean<br />
					Leaving obscurity<br />
					You are standing in the middle of another world<br />
					It's hard to feel your real emotions<br />
					You are smiling in a shirt wet with bitter tears<br />
					Let me help you find a place to call it home<br />
					We're all trapped in a maze of relationships<br />
					Life goes on with or without you<br />
					I swim in the sea of the unconscious<br />
					I search for your heart, pursuing my true self

					<b>lyrics</b>
					<br />
					Traded my kaleidoscope<br />
					For a spyglass<br />
					Glints dance in time<br />
					Still I see clear as day<br />
					<br />
					Where once I feared Spring<br />
					Feel my face in the grass<br />
					But Winter won&rsquo;t wait<br />
					For us<br />
					<br />
					All we need is a movie night<br />
					Trip in the arcade light<br />
					A keepsake&rsquo;s a memory<br />
					Of the ordinary<br />
					<br />
					A wildfire affinity<br />
					Thought to fray like a candle<br />
					Couldn&rsquo;t stifle in a world<br />
					That they&rsquo;d wish on us<br />
					<br />
					If my message in a bottle<br />
					Washed ashore<br />
					Would the waking of tomorrow<br />
					Rest assured?<br />
					<br />
					<mark
						>&lsquo;Cuz my butterflies love butter fries<br />
						And sitting one and two<br />
						And my heart&rsquo;s a permutation of<br />
						A life with you<br
					/></mark>
					<br />
					It&rsquo;s the broken gaze<br />
					The silence that completes me<br />
					And meet once again<br />
					In a laughter ever changing<br />
					<br />
					I&rsquo;ll never stop fighting for this<br />
					I&rsquo;ll never stop fighting for this<br />
					<mark>I&rsquo;ll never stop fighting for this</mark>

				<div class="songs">
					<b>lyrics</b>
					<br />
					Fear's awake, anger beats loud, face reality<br />
					Never beat charity<br />
					The enemy you're fighting covers all society<br />
					(Damn right)<br />
					Mommy's not here, gotta fight<br />
					(All night)<br />
					Right here, Shadow 10 o'clock direction<br />
					Seize the moment, destroy the nation<br />
					Your rhyme is slow motion, give me motivation<br />
					Freaked out now, and dead on arrival<br />
					(What?)<br />
					Round up around, spit out<br />
					All over<br />
					Rhyme like a rolling stone<br />
					Comin' a crowd<br />
					Watch out, they move, they diss you loud<br />
					Guess what this sound, it bombs whole ground<br />
					(So round up)<br />
					Don't ease your pace, 'cuz enemy's brutal<br />
					Moment of truth, There ain't no truce<br />
					You're the only one, one world, one love<br />
					But the battle goes on, Shadows of Mass Destruction<br />
					Fear cuts deep within the gun wounds<br />
					You put your fate, destiny into the tomb<br />
					Hardest thing to do is change <br />
					From who you are now<br />
					To who you wanna be sooner (first)<br />
					Enemies decided its ready<br />
					Whoever makes it out<br />
					Maybe be ready for the battle<br />
					(its fearless)<br />
					You better be ready now<br />
					Not only winning but loosing<br />
					Only brings experience for a bigger win later<br />
					Persevere for the greater good <br />
					Imagine their world<br />
					Made the annihilator<br />
					Take it down to ashes<br />
					Till you miss the violators<br />
					They'll give you all the time <br />
					But you can reach the fire later so<br />
					Hurry up it gets vicious and brutal<br />
					Moment of truth there ain't no truce<br />
					Your the only one, one world, one love <br />
					But the battle goes on<br />
					Shadows of mass destruction.<br />
					I'd rather take down these enemies.<br />
					They better run when they see me.<br />
					Make them feed back their energies.<br />
					We hold this feat for the best team.<br />
					It's a takeover.<br />
					Can't run away from the boss.<br />
					Game's over.<br />
					Keep throwing twice the more they mess with me.<br />
					Don't pester me.<br />
					Rest is history.

					<br />
					Love is fun, it's more than meets the eye<br />
					What's in love? Well one cup of your life<br />
					Plus mine, and that will be us and it's totally fine<br />
					And you know I'm upset 'cause no wonder I'm left<br />
					In the ground, left to precede in your steps<br />
					And there's no one to beg for some help<br />
					So I'm stuck in this mess, praying for you to come rescue me<br />
					Could it be you and me?<br />
					Not for real, then what's real?<br />
					Then what's real? Then what's real? Then what's real?<br />
					<mark>
						Is this love? Is this love?<br />
						Is this love? Is this love that I'm feeling?<br />
					</mark>
					Is this love? Is this love that I'm feeling?<br />
					Is this love? Is this love that I'm feeling?<br />
					Is this love? Is this love that I'm feeling?
