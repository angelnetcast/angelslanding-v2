		<h1>my music</h1>
		<p>
			during middle school i made music in garageband. using liveloops to make an
			album (which i still have! archive your stuff!!) was my introduction to
			"making music". i don't make music that much anymore, because i have a hard
			time creating something i like.
		</p>
		<p>
			every once-in-a-while, i get an idea for a song. if i make something decent,
			i'll upload it to soundcloud and link it here. been trying to make a bossa
			nova song for ages, i have a cute concept to make an ep out of bunny robot
			song.

				<b>a lullaby for a princess (bunny robot song)</b> - cyberangel
				<br />
				i made this song for a class at school. it is very robotic and simple
				because i was focused on the melody.

				<b>story:</b> in a floating castle not too far from here resides a bunny
				robot. she is old and nearly nonfunctional, but sometimes you can hear her
				gentle melody floating down to greet you. it is said that long ago she was
				the caretaker of the children residing in that castle, before it rose from
				the ground. in the heights of their reign, the royal family had supported
				all kinds of creative endeavours favored by their subjects. they were the
				most colorful and technologically advanced kingdom for miles. unfortunately,
				this mighty kingdom fell. no one knows why, but all of the residents had
				dissappeared and the castle began to float into the sky. all of the robots
				and art were left behind. one-by-one, the art decayed and the robots
				deactivated. the only thing left is the bunny robot, singing her calm melody
				until her last moments.

				i enjoy singing a lot but i hate hearing my voice on recording. i used to
				sing during my livestreams but my computer can't handle streaming anymore.

				back, i'll upload something here.
