						i feel like my first time listening to this album really changed my course
						of thinking at the time! though i'll expand on that more in the shrine i'm
						planning to make in the future. i'd reccomend listening to i've still got
						something to teach you in early hours of morning (when it's still dark
						out) either on really loud speakers or on noise cancelling headphones
						while lying on the floor. very specific instructions but i love hearing it
						this way :p

						appreciate it. my favorite is harper because of the electronic feel to it,
						it just scratches my brain. (i don't really care for the first part of
						bonnie still but i can listen to it. love the second half tho!)
