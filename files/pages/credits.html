			<h1>credits</h1>
			<p>
				there's a big issue with a lack of crediting on the internet. here i will
				keep track of what i've used across the site. if there is anything specific
				you are curious about, issues with something i have displayed, or otherwise
				email me at <u>contact at angelnetcast dot com</u>
			</p>

			<h2>images</h2>
			<h3>characters</h3>
			<p>
				cake, the purple cat, is a character created by me (angelnetcast) for this
				website. most of the drawings of it are created by me. please do not take
				art of it or use its design for personal/commercial use.
			</p>
			<p>
				snoopy is owned by peanuts worldwide llc and konata izumi is owned by kagami
				yoshimizu. i do not claim ownership of any characters on this website. if
				you wish for the removal of your character from this site, please send me an
				email.
			</p>
			<h3>decorations</h3>
			<p>
				a lot of my
				<span class="caption" title="ex: the decorations on my travel page"
					>"graphical decorations"</span
				>
				are from pinterest. i save all things i use and consider using in
				<a href="https://pin.it/7xcOpvMQI">this board.</a> i do my best not to use
				other people's custom art, and focus my decorations on background elements
				and popular characters. for this reason, you probably won't see a lot of
				pixel art/stamps on my website.
			</p>

			<p>
				all blinkies on the site are from
				<a href="https://blinkies.cafe/wall">blinkies.cafe</a>
