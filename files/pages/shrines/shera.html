		<!--OVERVIEW-->
		<h2>overview</h2>
		<p>
			november 13, 2018 saw the release of she-ra and the princesses of power on
			netflix. this show is a <i>reboot</i> of 1980's she-ra: princess of power.
			created by
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson"
				title="link to wikipedia (side note: a lot of nd's projects have had some impact on my life! lumberjanes and nimona are so awesome and you should check them out...)"
				>nd stevenson</a
			>
			, the show follows <mark>adora and catra</mark>. soliders of the tyrannical
			horde, they live a hard life training under shadow weaver. one day adora and
			catra find themselves lost in the whispering woods. after a series of
			mishaps, adora gains posession of the sword of protection and turns into the
			<u>legendary protector she-ra</u>! after this, adora and catra find
			themselves seperated. adora leaves the horde for the rebellion, swapping the
			drab atmosphere of the fright zone for the vibrant looks of bright moon.
			catra, however, grows bitter after being left for the princesses they were
			raised to hate. <b>the story continues</b> from this point with both women on
			opposite sides of a war, primarily focusing on the
			<u>heated conflicft</u> they have as their history interferes with their
			goals.

		<!--EXPERIENCE-->
		<h2>my viewing experience</h2>
		<p>
			i started watching spop on <u>march 31st, 2019</u>. (and that information is
			<span
				class="caption"
				title="i went to netflix and downloaded a .csv of my watch history to see the exact date i started watching the show. thanks to the profile transfer feature, this information wasn't lost! (had to move my profile to a diff acc thanks 2 all the location restrictions netflix started implementing on accounts, ew -_-)"
				>fact checked...</span
			>
			i am dedicated to documentation when possible o7)
		</p>
		<p>
			i started watching this pre-quarantine, but
			<u>i remember my interest really starting to deepen in the winter</u> (so
			late 2019-early 2020). the s5 release was a big deal for me! this was one of
			<i>many</i> shows i was watching
			<span
				class="caption"
				title="we weren't having a watch party or anything, just watching by ourselves and spending a lot of time coming back and talking about the latest episodes and fanart"
				>"with"</span
			>
			my best friend, so i vividly remember us anticipating the new season and
			talking about it at school.
		</p>
		<p>
			my favorite episode was
			<span class="caption" title="spop s5 ep5">save the cat</span>, which had the
			biggest emotional impact on me. i'm not much of a crier, but this episode
			genuinely had me <u>on the floor in front of the tv</u>. not crying, but
			visibly distraught at the state of my favorite character.
			<i
				><span
					class="caption"
					title="i wasn't allowed to watch gravity falls or steven universe which i know did some technically similar things at an earlier time, so this was my first exposure to some heavier plot points and more emotional scenes. (i know the not allowed thing is a shock to many but that's a story for another time and place :p)"
					>i was surprised that they would depict such pain in a children's
					show</span
				></i
			>, and even more surprised by how much i was moved by it. i attribute having
			such a connection to a character to the way i was able to watch the show at a
			steady pace (instead of binging the whole thing) as well as how connected i
			felt to the characters based on the new possibilities i was being presented
			to. <b>which brings us to:</b>
		</p>

		<!--IMPACT-->
		<h2>impact</h2>
		<p>
			around the time in my life that i was watching this i had just discovered
			what gay people were. yes, i'm not joking, i just straight up didn't know and
			no one told me. so as a result i was pretty deep in the "figure out your
			identity" phase of my life, as most middle schoolers are lol. spop had a
			pretty big impact on me as <u>the first lgbtq+ media i consumed</u>,
			especially considering that the main characters are
			<b>canonly married lesbians</b>. being able to see that on tv finally knocked
			into my brain that if i desired as much, i could marry a woman in the future.
			looking back, i'm really happy i was able to experience a show like spop in
			such an important phase of my life identity-wise!
		</p>

		<!--FANDOM-->
		<h2>online community</h2>
		<p>
			it's time to talk about my fandom experience. which, if i'm being honest,
			<b>is incredibly miniscule!</b> crazy left turn. i wasn't allowed on
			<span class="caption" title="shoutout to pinterest my one lifeline"
				>most social media</span
			>
			until 2020, so i didn't interact much until the end of the show. i made a few
			flipnote fan mvs on the show (mostly catradora, mostly forever unfinished in
			my ds files) but i spent the majority of my time accumulating a whopping
			<i><b>~3,900 pins</b></i> on a
			<span
				class="caption"
				title="the board is now archived but i did that from around 2020-2021? rough estimate"
				>she-ra pinterest board</span
			>. in that time i saw
			<a
				href="https://www.instagram.com/su_ggushi/?hl=en"
				title="su_ggushi on instagram"
				>su_ggushi</a
			>
			and
			<a
				href="https://artofkace.tumblr.com/"
				title="artofkace on tumblr (has since moved accounts)"
				>artofkace</a
			>'s fanarts the most. i still love their artstyles, the amount of detail they
			put into their fan work is truly impressive!
		</p>
		<p>
			on the topic of fanwork, i did see a handful of fan-compliations on youtube
			despite not being allowed on the site lol.
			<u>she-ra on crack and "x minutes of x"</u> type edits were truly the
			backbone of my existence at the time and i salute those who made the videos a
			reality o7
		</p>

		<!--CHARACTERS-->
		<h2>characters and ships</h2>
		<p>
			i really liked the way the show handled their characters and their arcs for
			the most part. you may want to take this with a grain of salt though, i
			havent rewatched the show in it's entirety since i originally finished it.
			ofc, my favorite character is <b>catra</b>, as
			<span
				class="caption"
				title="middle school me was definitely an interesting one to say the least. i had some shit going on then so that sure was a time lol"
				>i could relate to her</span
			>
			and i am also a huge sucker for cats. i thought the way they handled her was
			very interesting and tbh i was loving every second she was on screen.
			although i didn't relate to <b>adora</b> as much, i genuinely enjoyed
			following her for the majority of the show and the way she took back her
			destiny. also she's just a silly buff gay horse girl!
			<i>what's not to like!!!</i> tbh i don't really have much to say past that...
			although i do wish that some minor characters got more background (double
			trouble origin story please). but even though they don't get that it isn't
			necessarily needed, it would just be cool!
		</p>
		<p>
			<u>now, about ships...</u> i was quickly a catradora fan from the start. it
			was clear to me that something was there, and that was only solidified by
			episodes like
			<span
				class="caption"
				title="spop s1 ep8 - crazy moment when 'the dip' happened, i remember the tumblr screenshots were going NUTS over that one (admittedly i was too)"
				>princess prom</span
			>. i am a <b>huge sucker</b> for tragic love stories so the first few seasons
			were like pure drugs to me or something haha. high tension eps like the one
			in the crimson waste or with corrupted adora were great, but save the cat?
			<i><b>absolute insanity</b></i> for me. i was HOOKED. glimbow had less of an
			impact on me, i was more focused on the novel stuff at the time. i thought
			they were a cute couple though, longtime friends to lovers doesn't always
			work well so i'm glad the pairing didn't seem to take away from their
			characters before. i know there are a lot of poly ships in the fandom (ex:
			glimcatradora or whatever it's called) but those never really clicked with me
			bc glimbow and catradora seemed perfect on their own.
			<u>kyle, rogelio, and lonnie are totally dating tho.</u> the egg! the egg!!!
			i think the only thing i'll always wish for is some more story of netossa and
			spinerella. they're so cute... (also sea hawk and mermista's interactions
			were SO funny to me at the time i love them)
