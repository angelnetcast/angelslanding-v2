						funny description: depressed lesbians the show
						<br />
						puella magi madoka&#9734;magica (jp: mahou shoujo madoka&#9734;magica)
						began airing on january 7th, 2011. the story begins by following madoka
						kaname, a typical middle school student. she is approached by the
						otherworldly cat-looking being named kyubey to sign a contract to become a
						magical girl. surprisingly, a new transfer student named homura akemi
						seems to be against madoka signing a contract at all costs. i wonder why
						that is...?

					<h2>my viewing experience</h2>
					<p>
						i think this is one of the first animes i watched, i can't remember if it
						was this or
						<span class="caption" title="ouran high school host club">ohshc</span>??
						(i don't count pkmn/gf/ykw because i start counting at when i specifically
						began to seek out anime). i don't quite remember a lot of my feelings
						watching this, because i was in middle school. i do remember being scared
						to watch it on the living room tv because of the opening and the space
						scene in the last episode lol. also because i thought it was gay and i
						would get in trouble?? idk about that one.

					<h2>my favorite character</h2>
					<p>
						ok lets be real this is probably more of a homura akemi shrine than
						anything. homura.... you fought so hard i know. depressed middle school me
						was obsessed with this girl, i'm lucky i didn't have internet access
						beyond scratch at the time. i think my favorite thing about homura is her
						dedication to her <u>"good friend"</u> madoka. she starts off as a shy,
						unathletic kid who madoka takes under her wing. because of this she gets
						dragged into the magical girl fiasco though, and ends up having to watch
						madoka die. instead of just letting that happen, she makes a wish to be
						able to save madoka, allowing her to manipulate time and attempt to keep
						madoka from becoming a magical girl. with each time loop she becomes
						stronger and more dedicated, and to the point where the show starts she
						almost manages to save madoka! unfortunately, that brings us to this
						point...

					<h2>the tragic beauty of homura's story</h2>
					<p>
						to me, pmmm has always been a story about failure and hope at its core.
						because of this, i think that the ending of the anime really suits the
						story. i appreciate that they didn't go back to the feel of the first few
						episodes and make a "everything ends in sunshine and rainbows" type thing.
						to me, it is much more fitting that homura fails in the end. it is the
						perfect example of how sometimes though you might care of someone so much,
						you can't save them. i also think it's apt that madoka's wish ended up to
						absolve homura and all magical girls of their suffering by ensuring
						witches never existed. unfortunately, this turned her into a concept and
						she can only observe her friends on earth. also, witches are gone but a
						new entity has taken its place. in the end, human despair needs some sort
						of outlet. at least madoka was able to rid the world of witches...
