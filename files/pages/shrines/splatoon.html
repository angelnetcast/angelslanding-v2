    <h3>ranked</h3>
    <p>
      i am consistently at c rank because i never play series. i don't keep track of this usually. maybe one day i'll try for
      x-rank but for now i play in my friends s-rank lobbies sometimes.

    </p>

    <h2>splatfests</h2>
    <p>
      all splatfest teams i was on and ranked in splatoon 3. you can see how i quickly stopped playing them... i don't really like
      turf war. i didn't pick all of my fav options for the fests, half of the time my bf and i alternated who chose each fest and
      the times we didn't have opinons we picked to play w friends. any decisions that i was indecisive/would've picked
      differently are noted with &#9734;, hover to see more info!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>note: </b>splatoon 3 was the first time i got to experience splatfests (despite playing all 3 games) because when the other two
      came out i didn't have the console they were on until years after its release. since i already had a switch for splat2, i
      was early to the game for splat3!
