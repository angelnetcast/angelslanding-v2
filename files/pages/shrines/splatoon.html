				</p>
				<h3>ranked</h3>
				<p>
					i am consistently at c rank because i never play series. i don't keep track
					of this usually. maybe one day i'll try for x-rank but for now i play in my
					friends s-rank lobbies sometimes.
				</p>

				<h3>salmon run</h3>
				<p>eggsecutive vp</p>
				<p>(matching with randoms usually knocks me down to profresh tho -_-)</p>

				<h2>completion rate</h2>
				<p>
					<b>splatoon 1: </b>100% complete
					<br />
					<b>splatoon 2: </b>single run through complete (played all levels with at
					least 1 weapon)
					<br />
					<b>octo expansion: </b>incomplete
					<br />
					<b>splatoon 3: </b>alterna fully explored (all levels played with at least
					1 weapon)
					<br />
					<b>side order: </b>spire clear twice (high score 26616p)
				</p>

				<h2>splatfests</h2>
				<p>
					all splatfest teams i was on and ranked in splatoon 3. you can see how i
					quickly stopped playing them... i don't really like turf war. i didn't pick
					all of my fav options for the fests, half of the time my bf and i
					alternated who chose each fest and the times we didn't have opinons we
					picked to play w friends. any decisions that i was indecisive/would've
					picked differently are noted with &#9734;, hover to see more info!
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>note: </b>splatoon 3 was the first time i got to experience splatfests
					(despite playing all 3 games) because when the other two came out i didn't
					have the console they were on until years after its release. since i
					already had a switch for splat2, i was early to the game for splat3!
