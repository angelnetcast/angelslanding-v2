				<!--OVERVIEW-->
				<section>
					<h2>overview</h2>
					<p>
						november 13, 2018 saw the release of she-ra and the princesses of power on
						netflix. this show is a <i>reboot</i> of the 1980's she-ra: princess of
						power. created by
						<a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_Stevenson"
							title="link to wikipedia (side note: a lot of nd's projects have had some impact on my life! lumberjanes and nimona are so awesome and you should check them out...)"
							>nd stevenson</a
						>
						, the show follows <mark>adora and catra</mark>. soliders of the
						tyrannical horde, they live a hard life training under shadow weaver. one
						day adora and catra find themselves lost in the whispering woods. after a
						series of mishaps, adora gains posession of the sword of protection and
						turns into the <u>legendary protector she-ra</u>! after this, adora and
						catra find themselves seperated. adora leaves the horde for the rebellion,
						swapping the drab atmosphere of the fright zone for the vibrant looks of
						bright moon. catra, however, grows bitter after being left for the
						princesses they were raised to hate. <b>the story continues</b> from this
						point with both women on opposite sides of a war, primarily focusing on
						the <u>heated conflict</u> they have as their history interferes with
						their goals.

				<!--EXPERIENCE-->
				<section>
					<h2>my viewing experience</h2>
					<p>
						i started watching spop on <u>march 31st, 2019</u>. (and that information
						is
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="i went to netflix and downloaded a .csv of my watch history to see the exact date i started watching the show. thanks to the profile transfer feature, this information wasn't lost! (had to move my profile to a diff acc thanks 2 all the location restrictions netflix started implementing on accounts, ew -_-)"
							>fact checked...</span
						>
						i am dedicated to documentation when possible o7)
					</p>
					<p>
						i started watching this pre-quarantine, but
						<u>i remember my interest really starting to deepen in the winter</u> (so
						late 2019-early 2020). the s5 release was a big deal for me! this was one
						of <i>many</i> shows i was watching
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="we weren't having a watch party or anything, just watching by ourselves and spending a lot of time coming back and talking about the latest episodes and fanart"
							>"with"</span
						>
						my best friend, so i vividly remember us anticipating the new season and
						talking about it at school.
					</p>
					<p>
						my favorite episode was
						<span class="caption" title="spop s5 ep5">save the cat</span>, which had
						the biggest emotional impact on me. i'm not much of a crier, but this
						episode genuinely had me <u>on the floor in front of the tv</u>. not
						crying, but visibly distraught at the state of my favorite character.
						<i
							><span
								class="caption"
								title="i wasn't allowed to watch gravity falls or steven universe which i know did some technically similar things at an earlier time, so this was my first exposure to some heavier plot points and more emotional scenes. (i know the not allowed thing is a shock to many but that's a story for another time and place :p)"
								>i was surprised that they would depict such pain in a children's
								show</span
							></i
						>, and even more surprised by how much i was moved by it. i attribute
						having such a connection to a character to the way i was able to watch the
						show at a steady pace (instead of binging the whole thing) as well as how
						connected i felt to the characters based on the new possibilities i was
						being presented to. <b>which brings us to:</b>
					</p>
				</section>

				<!--IMPACT-->
				<section>
					<h2>impact</h2>
					<p>
						around the time in my life that i was watching this i had just discovered
						what gay people were. yes, i'm not joking, i just straight up didn't know
						and no one told me. so as a result i was pretty deep in the "figure out
						your identity" phase of my life, as most middle schoolers are lol. spop
						had a pretty big impact on me as
						<u>the first lgbtq+ media i consumed</u>, especially considering that the
						main characters are <b>canonly married lesbians</b>. being able to see
						that on tv finally knocked into my brain that if i desired as much, i
						could marry a woman in the future. looking back, i'm really happy i was
						able to experience a show like spop in such an important phase of my life
						identity-wise!
					</p>
				</section>

				<!--FANDOM-->
				<section>
					<h2>online community</h2>
					<p>
						it's time to talk about my fandom experience. which, if i'm being honest,
						<b>is incredibly miniscule!</b> crazy left turn. i wasn't allowed on
						<span class="caption" title="shoutout to pinterest my one lifeline"
							>most social media</span
						>
						until 2020, so i didn't interact much until the end of the show. i made a
						few flipnote fan mvs on the show (mostly catradora, mostly forever
						unfinished in my ds files) but i spent the majority of my time
						accumulating a whopping
						<i><b>~3,900 pins</b></i> on a
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="the board is now archived but i did that from around 2020-2021? rough estimate"
							>she-ra pinterest board</span
						>. in that time i saw
						<a
							href="https://www.instagram.com/su_ggushi/?hl=en"
							title="su_ggushi on instagram"
							>su_ggushi</a
						>
						and
						<a
							href="https://artofkace.tumblr.com/"
							title="artofkace on tumblr (has since moved accounts)"
							>artofkace</a
						>'s fanarts the most. i still love their artstyles, the amount of detail
						they put into their fan work is truly impressive!
					</p>
					<p>
						on the topic of fanwork, i did see a handful of fan-compliations on
						youtube despite not being allowed on the site lol.
						<u>she-ra on crack and "x minutes of x"</u> type edits were truly the
						backbone of my existence at the time and i salute those who made the
						videos a reality o7
					</p>

				<!--CHARACTERS-->
				<section>
					<h2>characters and ships</h2>
					<p>
						i really liked the way the show handled their characters and their arcs
						for the most part. you may want to take this with a grain of salt though,
						i havent rewatched the show in it's entirety since i originally finished
						it. ofc, my favorite character is <b>catra</b>, as
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="middle school me was definitely an interesting one to say the least. i had some shit going on then so that sure was a time lol"
							>i could relate to her</span
						>
						and i am also a huge sucker for cats. i thought the way they handled her
						was very interesting and tbh i was loving every second she was on screen.
						although i didn't relate to <b>adora</b> as much, i genuinely enjoyed
						following her for the majority of the show and the way she took back her
						destiny. also she's just a silly buff gay horse girl!
						<i>what's not to like!!!</i> tbh i don't really have much to say past
						that... although i do wish that some minor characters got more background
						(double trouble origin story please). but even though they don't get that
						it isn't necessarily needed, it would just be cool!
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>now, about ships...</u> i was quickly a catradora fan from the start.
						it was clear to me that something was there, and that was only solidified
						by episodes like
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="spop s1 ep8 - crazy moment when 'the dip' happened, i remember the tumblr screenshots were going NUTS over that one (admittedly i was too)"
							>princess prom</span
						>. i am a <b>huge sucker</b> for tragic love stories so the first few
						seasons were like pure drugs to me or something haha. high tension eps
						like the one in the crimson waste or with corrupted adora were great, but
						save the cat? <i><b>absolute insanity</b></i> for me. i was HOOKED.
						glimbow had less of an impact on me, i was more focused on the novel stuff
						at the time. i thought they were a cute couple though; longtime friends to
						lovers doesn't always work well so i'm glad the pairing didn't seem to
						take away from their characters before. i know there are a lot of poly
						ships in the fandom (ex: glimcatradora or whatever it's called) but those
						never really clicked with me bc glimbow and catradora seemed perfect on
						their own. <u>kyle, rogelio, and lonnie are totally dating tho.</u> the
						egg! the egg!!! i think the only thing i'll always wish for is some more
						story of netossa and spinerella. they're so cute... (also sea hawk and
						mermista's interactions were SO funny to me at the time i love them)
