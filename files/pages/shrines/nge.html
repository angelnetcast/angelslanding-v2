        <br />
        on october 4th, 1995, neon genesis evangelion (jp: shinseiki evangelion) began airing on television. it was directed by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideaki_Anno" target="_blank">hideaki anno</a> and animated by
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainax"
          target="_blank"
          title="they animated flcl and panty and stocking if you're not familiar"
          >gainax</a
        >, and had a 26 episode run. multiple movies were made after the anime was finished. "the end of evangelion" was released
        as an alternate ending to the main series in 1997, and four "rebuild" movies were released throughout 2007-2021. the main
        plot follows shinji ikari, as he is placed in a humanoid mecha called evangelion unit 01 and sent to fight angels to
        protect tokyo-3.

      <h2>my thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        nge is hands down <u>my favorite anime</u>. i watched it in 10th grade with a friend and it quickly became something that
        consumed my everyday thoughts. despite this, eva is one of the shows i am <i>hesitant to reccomend</i>. the show is old,
        and it contains weird fan service "camera" angles which usually sexualize minors??? which is unfortunately hard to ignore
        because it's pretty frequent when rei or asuka are on screen. usually, this type of thing would quickly put me off of a
        show but i was a few episodes in at this point, and really wanted to know more about this world. the mechas, angels, and
        nerv seemed really intriguing, so i was willing to stick it out to see if my questions got answered. i decided that if i
        got to the end or couldn't stand it anymore, i'd drop the show. well, by now i've watched every episode of eva and all of
        the movies. i've

          >phone cases</span
        >. i just can't seem to let go of the show. i'm a sucker for sci-fi, big robots,

          class="caption"
          title="that part is probably because of my own upbringing and mental health but oh well. love when my little guys are in situations."
          >tragic child solider stuff</span
        >, the works. it sounds dumb to say but evangelion was one of those things that came into my life at a weird time.
        consequently, it changed my thinking and i think permanently altered the person i was. i'd certainly be different if i
        never watched eva. <span class="caption" title="that's a joke. if it wasn't clear-">maybe less autistic...?</span>

        <b>note:</b> i obviously don't condone all of the actions of the characters in the show, some of the stuff they do is
        clearly fucked up and should not be replicated. just because someone likes a show does not mean they agree with the
        actions made. i'd usually assume this was universally understood, but you don't really know with the state of the internet
        these days...
      </p>

      <h2>my favorite characters</h2>
      <p>
        i would like for <b>rei ayanami</b> to take center stage!!! i related to her a lot throughout the show (as well as ms
        lookalike in the movies). she just forever has a special place in my heart. her mannerisms remind me of when i was in
        middle/elementary school, and just trying to pass with following instructions and doing nothing more. similar to her
        character arc, i realized there are people i care about and things i want to do for myself. which is good. yay!
      </p>
      <p>
        a lot of people hate <b>shinji ikari</b>, they say he is whiny and spineless and should've done more. but if i was in his
        place, fuck, i would've reacted the same way he did. i think people forget that he is 14, and are used to the typical "mc
        is a hero and they do what they need to to make sure everyone survives". i honestly love when it's more complicated than
        that. i really like how shinji was written throughout the show and i think people should remember that he's only a kid.
      </p>
      <p><b>misato katsuragi</b> if i get to be 29 and i'm like you i might be winning.</p>
