		<h2>what the heck happened here?</h2>
		<p>
			hey! if you're a returning visitor, i bet you're wondering where all the
			stuff went. the button carousel, the purple cat, that type of thing. well, as
			mentioned on the landing page, <u>angel's landing</u> is currently under
			crazy heavy construction. as i've worked on this site, i've gained a lot more
			experience than i had when i started. i think it is best for the site if i
			start over and rewrite everything from the ground up. css color variables,
			actually wrapping text in paragraph tags, a uniform theme in css, those type
			of things. hopefully this makes it easier for me to expand on the site in the
			future!
		</p>
		<h2>what about the stuff that was here before?</h2>
		<p>
			most of the old pages will be migrated here. as i move things, i'm focusing
			on the content first. as a result, most (if not all of the site) will be
			primarily text based with minimal styling like this page. cake and its lovely
			purple (and maybe some new variants...?) will make their return in due time,
			accompanied by some newer, <b><i>cooler</i></b> things. <u>i promise!</u>
