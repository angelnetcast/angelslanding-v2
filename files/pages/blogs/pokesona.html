					<h1>the pokesona analysis</h1>
					<h3>
						i try to figure out which pokemon would work best as my pokesona.
						(spoiler: i don't pick one yet)
					</h3>
					<h2>my history with pokemon (and the reason for this blog)</h2>
					<p>
						soooo, as a kid i was pretty into pokemon. (at least, as much as someone
						can be having never played a pokemon game...) i watched
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="i think the 'pokemon the series: xy' was airing at the time"
							>the anime</span
						>
						and i had a pokedex. i also had pokemon rumble on my wii, but it was only
						the demo so i just went through that portion of the game over and over.
						though once my mom rented <u>pokepark wii: pikachu's adventure</u> from
						gamefly and it was the best week of my life! good times...
					</p>
					<p>
						anywho, i'm not big into pokemon now but i've had good times with it.
						recently, i've been interested in making a pokesona. no particular reason,
						i just think it could be cool. but there are like, *checks notes*
						<i>1025 pokemon?????</i> last i checked there were 725 o-0 point is, way
						too many to choose from. consequently, i'll be listing some here and their
						qualities to make them a good pokesona. if i ever end up deciding and
						making a pokesona, i'll put it here.
