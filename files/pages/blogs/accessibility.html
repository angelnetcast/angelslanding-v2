					<h1>The Angel’s Landing Accessibility Effort</h1>
					<h3>Doing my part to make sure the web is for everyone!</h3>
					<p>April 8th, 2025.</p>
					<p>
						When I first joined Neocities, a lot of the websites I visited had notes
						for potential mobile users. They often said something along the lines of
						“This website isn’t made for phones, go on a computer!” or “Mobile users
						eat shit” or things of that nature. Being an amateur coder at the time, I
						put a disclaimer on my own site stating that it is not mobile accessible.
						I promptly forgot about it and continued learning to code, and I’ve gotten
						to where I am today, on v2 of my website and writing this blog post.
					</p>
					<p>
						There was one big thing that made me want to focus on accessibility, but
						some smaller things I had noted previously didn’t hurt the development of
						that idea.
					</p>
					<p>
						While working on v1.5, there was no significant CSS. Everything was just
						plain tags and a few colors, like the super old web. I did this to make
						the code in my site easier to modify long term, because v1 was becoming a
						spaghetti mess. While working on this, I noticed that Firefox offered me
						an option to read my webpage in Reading Mode. I thought that might be
						helpful, so I made a mental note to look into that later.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that we’re on v2, a lot of my theme from v1 is back. Blog posts,
						diaries, and silly drawings of Cake galore. Because I’ve always used the
						display: grid; property, my website doesn’t look too bad on mobile. I do
						notice I can’t use a reading mode tool anymore though, and everything is
						just a little unwieldy. The best way to visit Angel’s Landing was still a
						computer.
					</p>
					<p>
						One day, I’m perusing Neocities as one does, and I came across
						<a
							href="https://whiona.weblog.lol/2023/09/on-mobile-phones-the-small-web-and-able-bodied-privilege"
							>this blog post</a
						>
						by Whiona. In the post, she talks about how fibromyalgia has affected her
						web browsing. She can’t use her computer as much as she likes because of
						the pain it causes, so using a phone to surf the web is a more viable
						option. Unfortunately, a lot of sites on the indie web are not built with
						mobile in mind or are actively hostile to the idea. She goes into more
						detail about her situation in the post, I encourage you to read it if you
						haven’t! The point I’d like to make is that this made me realize that I
						hadn’t considered disability in the creation of my site at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have zero experience with physical disability, but I have issues of my
						own. I’ve felt what it feels like to want to experience something, but you
						can’t because the environment is hostile to your health for whatever
						reason. I’m embarrassed to admit that I did not consider how this could
						happen on the internet as well. Angel’s Landing is a place for me to share
						things I’m passionate about with as many people who visit. I do not want
						to contribute to the mountain of sites that alienate mobile users. In all
						honesty, I consider the self-expression and ideas shared on my site to be
						its primary purpose. No matter the reasoning behind someone visiting on
						Angel’s Landing, they should still be able to view the text displayed
						here.
					</p>
					<h2>What does this mean for Angel’s Landing?</h2>
					<p>
						As a result of what I’ve mentioned above, I’ve begun work to make my site
						more accessible. It will certainly take a while, require re-coding some
						things, a lot of trial and error, and some patience. But at the end of the
						day, that’s my every day when building a website. I have fun either way,
						and I’d like to make a place where all are welcome.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’m sure some of my sillier pages and the stylization present on this site
						will need to be adjusted, but I’ll do my best to find a middle ground in
						that regard. Angel’s Landing will still probably always be best viewed on
						a computer, but I will do my best to make sure it is usable on mobile. I
						also want to mention that I am not talking solely about mobile
						accessibility. I want screen readers to be able to read the site, and make
						sure you can navigate with a keyboard. If there are any tools used for web
						accessibility that I could optimize for, please let me know.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ll be making a point to consider accessibility in any new pages from now
						on. I will also create a list of goals I intend to meet. These will be
						listed on the <a href="/pages/accessibility.html">accessibility</a> page
						and should be true across the entire site. If you run into any issues,
						have suggestions, complaints, comments, or otherwise, send me an email at
						<u>angel at angelnetcast dot com</u> and I’ll get back to you when I can.
					</p>
					<h2>What needs to be done?</h2>
					<p>
						I’m only one person and this website is just a fun project so this will
						probably take a while. Here’s what I know I need to work on, so you can
						have an idea of what’s to come.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check font sizes</li>
						<li>Check color contrast</li>
						<li>Pausable GIFs</li>
						<li>Swap to semantic HTML</li>
						<li>Use aria tags</li>
					</ul>
