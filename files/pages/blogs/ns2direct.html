					<h1>My Thoughts on the Nintendo Switch 2</h1>
					<h3>
						A recap and discussion of important details from the Nintendo Direct and
						information about the new console.
					</h3>
					<p>Initial Post Date: April 2nd, 2025</p>
					<p>
						This morning, Nintendo broadcasted a Nintendo Direct going into more
						detail about the Nintendo Switch 2 and its games and features. My friends
						and I enjoyed watching it together and we chatted excitedly about the
						upcoming games and features. I was in a pretty good mood after that, but
						later in the day I began to do more research, and I was concerned with
						some things I’ve learned.
					</p>
					<h1>The Console</h1>
					<p>Some of the most important things to note about the Switch 2 are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1080p screen handheld and 4K resolution support using the dock</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Also note that 120 fps is possible</li>
							<li>I’m not a big specs guy but that is a nice upgrade</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Joy-Con 2 are magnetic instead of the previous rail system</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Can also be used as a mouse in specific games</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Super Mario Party Jamboree and Drag x Drive are the two titles
									demonstrated to use this feature so far
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>GameChat</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Discord voice chat on switch basically</li>
							<li>
								Allows you to voice chat, share screen, or videochat with other players.
							</li>
							<li>You can be playing different games which is sweet!</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Camera accessory</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Camera can be used in some games</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Significantly improved flexible console stand</li>
						<li>
							<span class="caption" title="thank god"
								>Charging on top and bottom of console</span
							>
						</li>
						<li>256gb built in</li>
						<li>GameShare</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Pretty much a revival of the 3DS line’s Download Play</li>
							<li>
								Any Switch 2 console can share compatible games locally even if the
								other player doesn’t own the game
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>
						All these things are what I’m primarily excited about for the Switch 2.
						However, despite all these new features I will not be buying a console on
						launch. Frequent visitors of my site may remember my January 17th diary
						entry where I discussed conditions that would need to be met before I
						purchased a Switch 2.
					</p>
					<p>Immediate purchase conditions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tomodachi Life 2</li>
						<li>Splatoon 4</li>
						<li>Animal Crossing</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Combination purchase conditions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>StreetPass returns</li>
						<li>Home menu themes return</li>
						<li>Miis make a large return</li>
						<li>Splatoon themed console</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						As you are probably aware, Tomodachi Life 2 is a thing and will be
						released in 2026.
						<span class="caption" title="as far as I’m aware… it better not be-"
							>Luckily, that game is not Switch 2 exclusive.</span
						>
						Consequently, I have no real reason to go buy a Switch 2 on launch. My
						current Switch works fine, and Splatoon is my only “have to have” game
						series. My wallet remains safe for now…
					</p>
					<h1>Announced Games</h1>
					<p>Here are some that I am personally excited about:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Kirby Air Riders</li>
						<li>Mario Kart World</li>
						<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
						<li>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</li>
						<li>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</li>
						<li>DELTARUNE 3 + 4</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Really excited for Hollow Knight fans as well, considering Silksong was
						confirmed for a 2025 release on the new console. None of these are games I
						need to get immediately - especially considering some aren’t switch
						exclusive - but I will surely be looking forward to adding them to my
						collection at some point.
					</p>
					<h1>Minor Gripes</h1>
					<p>
						My main desire for the Switch 2 in terms of the actual console was a
						revival of home menu themes and the StreetPass system. We are not getting
						any of those things (yet…?) but I feel like their presence in the 3DS
						really gave the system personality. While the Wii and Wii U didn’t have
						themes built in, their home menus had a specific theme, personality, and
						music. The Switch has a gray background with no music and a bunch of game
						tiles which is just super boring. After Nintendo’s release of the Wii in
						2006, they returned to the handheld market with the 3DS in 2010. Features
						like StreetPass and Play Coins were introduced that took advantage of the
						portability of the console. Following the 3DS, the Wii U’s release
						returned to the home console focus. The Switch line is in a unique
						position where it fits the requirements to be a home and portable console.
						I feel there is a lot of wasted potential with creative features on the
						Switch. Ideally, there could be a combination of portable features and
						docked features that make the most of the console’s versatility. I would
						love to see a Switch with achievements and StreetPass, the best of both
						worlds… Unfortunately, we are seemingly stuck with an uninspired system
						that tries to fit in with the rest. Nintendo’s past quirky creations truly
						drew me in. It seems to me that a larger focus is being put on the specs
						of a console which is damaging creativity. I hope to see that creativity
						make a return…
					</p>
					<h1>Major Gripes</h1>
					<p>
						Hey so why is the physical copy of Mario Kart World projected to be $80
						USD? Holy FUCK, $500 USD for the Switch 2/MKW bundle. What’s with this
						staggered pre-order thing? Why are we continuing to paywall emulation of
						older consoles and attacking all alternatives? Last but not least, a
						special “what the fuck do you mean???” for the “Game Key Card” system.
					</p>
					<h2>Pre-Order Invitations</h2>
					<p>
						As I mentioned before I’m not planning on purchasing a Switch 2 anytime
						soon, so this doesn’t really apply to me. I can understand supply and
						demand, creating interest, various marketing tactics of the sort. However,
						it really strikes me as odd that you must register for a chance to
						preorder the console. Additionally, its not really first-coms first-serve
						because there are “priority criteria" requirements. To be considered a
						priority customer, you must meet three requirements as of today (4/2/25).
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Your account must have purchased an NSO membership</li>
						<li>You must have had the subscription for at least 1 year</li>
						<li>
							You need to share gameplay data with Nintendo and have 50hrs total of
							gameplay
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Again, I can sort of understand this process, but my main concern is
						people who don’t meet these requirements. Maybe they only want to send out
						preorders to diehard fans? It seems counterintuitive to me to limit the
						number of preorders unless there is some manufacturing issue. Maybe some
						people haven’t bought a console since the Wii and want to get something
						new right away but now they have to wait until they are regularly in
						stock. I feel like scalpers will cause a big issue as usual.
					</p>
					<h2>Cost Rise</h2>
					<p>
						Nintendo is an incredibly large company in the gaming industry. I think
						this increase in prices can cause a ripple across the entire industry
						which will make gaming so much more expensive as a hobby. Also, tariffs.
						Ugh…
					</p>
					<p>
						I do believe it’s important to support game developers and their work.
						Recently, purchases from Nintendo feel less and less like a show of
						support for the team behind the game for me. Nintendo’s attacks on their
						community over things like emulation and tournaments have really come to
						my attention
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="since I gained consciousness in 2020-ish but whatever"
							>in recent years</span
						>. I just feel as if this is a concerning direction to take.
					</p>
					<p>
						This article-ish thing is more formal than something I would usually write
						but I want to mention I really just don’t want to pay $90 dollars for one
						game. Especially considering the current climate with DLC and online
						subscription services often causing games to total much more than their
						initial cost. I also really don’t want to pay $450 for a new console right
						now, but that’s a personal issue.
					</p>
					<h2>NSO Expansion Pass</h2>
					<p>
						I’m going to preface this by saying I do have the expansion pass, though I
						do not pay for it. Despite this I am still going to criticize it, because
						I think it sucks. I do not like paying for online services and I
						especially don’t like that Nintendo has locked older games behind this
						system. Not only do they not allow any official avenues for purchasing
						older games, they require you to pay a reoccurring additional cost on top
						of the base online system for access. I would love if we could return to a
						“purchase once own forever” type system like Virtual Console games on the
						Wii and Wii U but alas, money talks. Which leads us to the last topic:
					</p>
					<h2>Game Key Cards</h2>
					<p>
						I have a lot of digital copies of games. I would rather buy a physical
						copy in most cases, though circumstances make it more reasonable for me to
						make digital purchases. Despite this, I expect to have the entire game
						when making a physical purchase. I should be able to insert the disk,
						cartridge, or whatever format, and everything loads and works. It is my
						current understanding that with the new Game Key Cards, you have to
						install the game through Wi-Fi after purchasing a physical copy. I am not
						too fond of that, but my real concern is long term availability.
						Eventually the servers that contain these games will be shut down which
						would render the cards useless. Not to mention the people who may not have
						internet access at all. They could purchase the game expecting to be able
						to play offline at home and be denied that opportunity. Also, assuming you
						can resell these cards and they would function like normal ones, this
						could create a reselling issue after the console’s lifespan. Considering
						Nintendo makes it really hard to legally obtain old games, we could be
						looking at a future of a resell market full of non-working key cards. That
						scenario also implies that games have two different card versions which
						wouldn’t make sense, so its entirely possible I’m just making up issues.
						Either way, I think these are important things to take into account. I’ll
						be keeping an eye on news around these game cards.
