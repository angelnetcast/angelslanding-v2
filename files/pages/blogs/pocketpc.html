					<h1>Finding A Use for the Pocket PC 2002</h1>
					<h2>10/13/23</h2>
					<p>
						My dad is cleaning out the garage for a move, and told me that I can keep
						some of the technology if i can find a use for it. So, the first gadget
						I’ll be documenting is the HP iPAQ PocketPC 2002!
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a discontinued
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"
							>Personal Digital Assistant</a
						>
						(PDA) from a line of Pocket PCs that started in 2000. They use the Windows
						Mobile interface but can also (unsurprisingly) run some Linux distros.
						These guys were intended for use as office assistants, but can also be
						used as portable media player thanks to the (mini) headphone jack and
						ability to play media imported from Windows Media Player. As of 10-8-23,
						you can still download the
						<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15"
							>ActiveSync</a
						>
						(<a
							href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250315001156/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15"
							>internet archive link</a
						>) software from Microsoft that was used to store and transfer things from
						your PC to Pocket PC. There is also a surprise infrared port on the side
						to (i assume) communicate with other devices!
					</p>
					<p>
						All this information makes the PocketPC look like a useful tool for its
						time. However, none of the email sharing/buisness functionality have any
						use to me right now, even if they did work. So my current plan is to turn
						this into a little media player and have my music saved on SD cards in the
						device to carry around with me! There are two issues with that plan
						though.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The battery is pillowing and the device won’t turn on if not plugged into
							the wall.
						</li>
						<li>I don’t have an adapter for the odd headphone jack in the device.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Both of these problems cost money to fix, which i’m not too keen on
						spending right now thanks to my recent PSP purchase. So whenever I make
						some progress on this project I’ll put an update here!
					</p>
					<h2>10/18/23</h2>
					<p>
						My teacher brought to my attention today that I could hardwire a battery
						instead of looking for scarce replacements. I will do more research on
						this eventually.
					</p>
					<h2>3/14/25</h2>
					<p>
						Long time no see! I've moved since I originally made this blog, and the
						PocketPC has been floating around the house for two years. I'm finally
						unpacking my stuff and beginning to set up my room...
						<br />
						Anyway, I ended up finding the PocketPC again. I decided to try a
						different approach to the battery issue. Originally, (as mentioned in the
						last entry), I was going to try and hardwire a battery. As of right now,
						I'm really more of a software guy than hardware. I have literally
						<u>no idea</u> how to even begin to do that. I ended up doing something I
						should've done originally and just took the battery out of the system to
						look at the exact model number and serial code. That's usually a thing I
						do but I guess I just forgot to this time.
					</p>
					<p>
						I found out some new useful information! I specifically have a HP iPAQ
						h1900 series PocketPc. I ended up finding
						<a href="https://www.pencomputing.com/frames/hp_ipaq_1900.html"
							>this article</a
						>
						(<a
							href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250314235301/https://www.pencomputing.com/frames/hp_ipaq_1900.html"
							>internet archive version</a
						>) which was a review of the product when it first released in 2003! Super
						cool stuff indeed. I also found some replacement batteries online. They
						cost about 20 bucks not including shipping, so I've set up a few options
						for what I can do.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Buy it now, and test it when I go home for Easter break.</li>
						<li>Wait until I graduate and buy it then.</li>
						<li>Wait until I get my summer job and buy it with my first paycheck.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						I'm leaning towards the second option because I will have all the time in
						the world (hopefully) to do my techy side projects during the summer. If I
						buy the battery now, I'll just be thinking about it while I'm at school
						and it will drive me nuts. We'll just have to see.
						<br />
						I am also realizing that this gives me something to do with my childhood
						computer! Exciting stuff. I've decided to maybe try the email stuff once I
						get the battery and music fixed. (Writing that made me think of
						<a href="https://kokoscript.com/2022/007.html">this</a> blog by
						KokoScript! I found it pretty interesting.) I'll have to find an infrared
						reader tho, cause that's the only communication this thing has.
						Additionally, I'll be archiving any links I come across, as well as saving
						manuals and drivers. Just in case anyone else stumbles across this in the
						future and wants to do the same thing!
					</p>
					<p>
						PS: I don't know if anyone is keeping up with this but I bet you thought I
						forgot about it! I didn't... I'm just busy and on an everchanging
						antidepressant cocktail. That's finally getting sorted out though so I
						hope to return to regular testing and updates in a few months!
