		<h1>Finding A Use for the Pocket PC 2002</h1>
		<h2>10/13/23</h2>
		<p>
			My dad is cleaning out the garage for a move, and told me that I can keep
			some of the technology if i can find a use for it. So, the first gadget I’ll
			be documenting is the HP iPAQ PocketPC 2002!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a discontinued
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"
				>Personal Digital Assistant</a
			>
			(PDA) from a line of Pocket PCs that started in 2000. They use the Windows
			Mobile interface but can also (unsurprisingly) run some Linux distros. These
			guys were intended for use as office assistants, but can also be used as
			portable media player thanks to the (mini) headphone jack and ability to play
			media imported from Windows Media Player. As of 10-8-23, you can still
			download the
			<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15"
				>ActiveSync</a
			>
			software from Microsoft that was used to store and transfer things from your
			PC to Pocket PC. There is also a surprise infrared port on the side to (i
			assume) communicate with other devices!
		</p>
		<p>
			All this information makes the Pocket PC look like a useful tool for its
			time. However, none of the email sharing/buisness functionality have any use
			to me right now, even if they did work. So my current plan is to turn this
			into a little media player and have my music saved on SD cards in the device
			to carry around with me! There are two issues with that plan though.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The battery is pillowing and the device won’t turn on if not plugged into
				the wall.
			</li>
			<li>I don’t have an adapter for the odd headphone jack in the device.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Both of these problems cost money to fix, which i’m not too keen on spending
			right now thanks to my recent PSP purchase. So whenever I make some progress
			on this project I’ll put an update here!

			My teacher brought to my attention today that I could hardwire a battery
			instead of looking for scarce replacements. I will do more research on this
			eventually.
