						I love old OSes (Windows 7 mwah), running old software, and old(ish)

					<h2>What I Had</h2>
					<p>
						Before I decided that my laptop was running like shit and I needed a fresh
						Windows install, I had a couple of things on my computer. The one that was
						the most set up was my Windows 2000 Professional. I got the .iso off of
						the Internet Archive (and it actually came with a product key) and set up
						a purple theme and SAPARi to mess with. This is also the only VM I have a
						screenshot of, because I thought it was cute lol. I put that photo below!
					</p>

						src="/assets/images/blog/vmsetup/win2k.jpg"

						alt="a screenshot of a windows 2000 desktop with a purple theme"
						title="my win2k setup!" />
					<p>
						I also had Windows XP and Windows 7 VMs. I couldn't get a product key for
						the WinXP one, but I was using UTAU software, tracker music stuff, and
						trying to do a thing with a midi keyboard on the Win7 machine.
					</p>

					<h2>"Had"?</h2>
					<p>
						So when I did the aforementioned reset, I exported all of my VMs to an
						external hard drive. Today (1-22-25) I redownloaded Virtural Box and
						loaded them back in, and that process seemed to go smoothly.
						Unfortunately, none of the VMs ran when I hit start! I got some error
						about hashes not matching up... so i gave up. (　；∀；) I decided to start
						over because there wasn't much on my old VMs anyway, so there's not much
						loss. Just some things I wanted to give a try. I may try and fix them
						later but that is a project for another day.
					</p>

					<h2>What I'm Currently Up To (as of 1-22-25)</h2>
					<p>
						I've been thinking about old chat systems recently. I saw
						<a href="https://aerochat.live/">AeroChat</a> and I thought it was really
						cute but I didn't want to
						<span
							class="caption"
							title="it is against discord tos to use a third-party client, and i like my account lol"
							>risk installing it</span
						>. Today I saw a
						<a href="https://youtu.be/taDOa2zIhlo?si=ZVZENPlI_nyMA961"
							>MattKCBites video</a
						>
						on <span class="caption" title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</span> and a
						lightbulb went off in my head. People still work on old software to make
						it work in the modern day and I can fucking download it! And use it!! I
						actually have been sitting at my desk for hours now like a shrimp, so I am
						going to write my plans down, take a shower and maybe eat something, then
						come back.
					</p>
					<p>Here's what I want to do:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Get working versions of all of my old VMs</li>
						<li>
							Put the old software I had back in them (ex: SAPARI, UTAU, tracker stuff)
						</li>
						<li>
							Install AIM and

				everything up but i remembered 'hey maybe i shouldn't download random shit
				onto my main computer' which prompted me to reinstall my vms which prompted
				the creation of this blog and so on..."
								>re-setup</span
							>
							the ChivaNet server and what not
						</li>
						<li>Check out NINA.chat and escargot.chat (thanks ashton!)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Okay I'm going to go do boring self care stuff now and I'll be back.</p>

					<h2>Next Day (1-23-25)</h2>
					<p>
						I did not come back I got sad and I got in bed lol. I went out and got sun
						and socialized today, so i'm gonna use the energy from that to do a little
						more today. Because I have a lot of other things to do that are of high
						academic priority, I'll download all of the .iso files I need to remake my
						VMs.
					</p>

					<h2>Canon Printers and Escargot.chat Update (6-23-25)</h2>
					<h3>Snail Chatting</h3>
					<p>By reccomendation of Ashton, I got Windows Live Messenger! It's quite cute but I don't have much to say about it other than that lol... feel free to send me a message tho! It's always open on my laptop tho, so feel free to send me a messaage @ angelnetcast@escargot.chat :3</p>

					<h3>Printer Trouble</h3>
					<p>I've been at work which means I get access to many old things! There are some old laptops in a storage room that i'm itching to get my hands on, but those are for another time...</p>
					<p>In true Angel fashion, I've tinkered around the office and messed with some old stuff. Right now, the object of my attention is a Canon imageRUNNER 2525. It was just sitting unused on one of the floors when my boss mentioned it was broken. He never specified exactly <i>how</i> it was broken, just that Canon wouldn't dispose of it or send someone to fix it. So I decided to tinker around and see what specifically was broken. After a bit of <span class="caption" title="i didn't realise there was a second power button and i had to research the default id and password">trial and error</span>, I managed to get it on and working! I tested the copy feature and it wrinkled up the paper it spit out, but the print job itself was decent. The whole thing is full of ink, and it even has a stapler feature!
					<br>
					Today we tried printing a board meeting packet and began to run into issues... it seems the rollers are super borked and wrinkle every paper they come across. You'll only get through a few pages of a print job before running into a paper jam (which is only actually there like half of the time??). So I'll have to figure out if I can fix that later. Scanning works fine though! It's just <u>reallyyyyyyy</u> slow. Scans to USB with minimal issues other than the occasional paperjam with weirdly shaped papers. A win is a win!</p>
