		<h2>What I Had</h2>
		<p>
			Before I decided that my laptop was running like shit and I needed a fresh
			Windows install, I had a couple of things on my computer. The one that was
			the most set up was my Windows 2000 Professional. I got the .iso off of the
			Internet Archive (and it actually came with a product key) and set up a
			purple theme and SAPARi to mess with. This is also the only VM I have a
			screenshot of, because I thought it was cute lol. I put that photo below!
		</p>

			alt="a screenshot of a windows 2000 desktop with a purple theme"
			title="my win2k setup!" />
		<p>
			I also had Windows XP and Windows 7 VMs. I couldn't get a product key for the
			WinXP one, but I was using UTAU software, tracker music stuff, and trying to
			do a thing with a midi keyboard on the Win7 machine.
		</p>

		<h2>"Had"?</h2>
		<p>
			So when I did the aforementioned reset, I exported all of my VMs to an
			external hard drive. Today (1-22-25) I redownloaded Virtural Box and loaded
			them back in, and that process seemed to go smoothly. Unfortunately, none of
			the VMs ran when I hit start! I got some error about hashes not matching
			up... so i gave up. (　；∀；) I decided to start over because there wasn't
			much on my old VMs anyway, so there's not much loss. Just some things I
			wanted to give a try. I may try and fix them later but that is a project for
			another day.
		</p>

		<h2>What I'm Currently Up To (as of 1-22-25)</h2>
		<p>
			I've been thinking about old chat systems recently. I saw
			<a href="https://aerochat.live/">AeroChat</a> and I thought it was really
			cute but I didn't want to
			<span

				title="it is against discord tos to use a third-party client, and i like my account lol"
				>risk installing it</span
			>. Today I saw a
			<a href="https://youtu.be/taDOa2zIhlo?si=ZVZENPlI_nyMA961"
				>MattKCBites video</a
			>
			on <span class="caption" title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</span> and a
			lightbulb went off in my head. People still work on old software to make it
			work in the modern day and I can fucking download it! And use it!! I actually
			have been sitting at my desk for hours now like a shrimp, so I am going to
			write my plans down, take a shower and maybe eat something, then come back.
		</p>
		<p>Here's what I want to do:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get working versions of all of my old VMs</li>
			<li>
				Put the old software I had back in them (ex: SAPARI, UTAU, tracker stuff)
			</li>
			<li>
				Install AIM and

					title="so i did set
				everything up but i remembered 'hey maybe i shouldn't download random shit
				onto my main computer' which prompted me to reinstall my vms which prompted
				the creation of this blog and so on..."
					>re-setup</span
				>
				the ChivaNet server and what not
			</li>
			<li>Check out NINA.chat and escargot.chat (thanks ashton!)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Okay I'm going to go do boring self care stuff now and I'll be back.</p>
