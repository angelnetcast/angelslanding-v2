		<h1>Sonic Symphony Concert</h1>
		<p>
			Sonic Symphony is doing a world tour, and I’ve got tickets to go!

			<br />
			For those who don’t know, Sonic Symphony is a performance of original
			arrangements from Sonic games. The first concert was for Sonic’s 30th
			anniversary and was a free live stream on YouTube (though I wasn’t aware of
			it then). The livestream is still up on YouTube, or you can find that music
			on Spotify.
			<br />
			<br />
			I’ll be on my way to see this as a Christmas present! It took me a little bit
			of time to convince my parents to buy some tickets but I got it done
			eventually. I’m sitting near the front (ish), and it turns out one of my
			friends is also going and I didn’t even know! I’ll be keeping an eye out for
			him then, but that’s the end of this.

			<br />
			I’ll put more updates when I get an outfit and when I have pictures of the
			event!

			I got to go to the concert a few days ago, and I will say that it was the
			best thing i've ever experienced! The Symphony was beautiful, and the metal
			half was super fun! I have never seen so many Sonic fans in the same place,
			so to see a theatre
			<i>full</i> of people who also like sonic was super awesome!
			<br />
			<br />
			Now, <i>technically</i>, my first concert was one of the Kidz Bop World Tour
			2019 shows, but i don't like to count it (especially because I won the
			tickets on the radio and otherwise would not have gone out of my way to get
			them, haha). Make no mistake, it <i>was</i> fun, but certainly not my first
			choice of live music.
			<br />
			<br />
			Some of my favorite songs during the performance were Palmtree Panic during
			the Sonic CD Medley, Green Hill Zone during the Sonic the Hedgehog Medley,
			His World (Sonic '06'), Undefeatable (Sonic Frontiers), I'm Here (Sonic
			Frontiers), Knight of the Wind (Sonic and the Black Knight), and I Am... All
			of Me (Shadow the Hedgehog). I liked a lot of the medley songs, but it was
			harder for me to distinguish them because they were all mixed together.
			<br />
			<br />
			One of my favorite total parts of the concert was the metal half. Because
			these songs had lyrics, the crowd was able to sing together! I didn't know a
			lot of these songs because I didn't play most Sonic games as a kid. I've
			never been very good at them, or asked for more of them (because I kept
			getting stuck at Ocean Palace in Sonic Heroes). Although I was a little out
			of the loop, the energy was palpable and contagious, and I had just as much
			fun watching everyone else enjoy themsleves!
			<br />
			<br />
			During the performace, you could tell the orchestra and band were having just
			as much fun as the audicence. They had so much chemistry together, and the
			music they were making sounded <i>beautiful</i>. It was apparent both groups
			worked incredibly hard to perfect the music they performed that night! The
			announcers who spoke in between some segments were so fun and I felt like
			they were enjoying themselves as well.
			<br />
			<br />
			All in all, that was the most fun i've had in a while and easily the best
			(out of three currently) live music experiences. The announcers told us that
			we were their most energetic concert yet, and with all of the singing and
			cheering we were doing I can certainly believe that! While having fun,
			everyone was incredibly respectful about not being so loud that the music was
			inaudible which I am very grateful for. I saw so many people in various Sonic
			themed outfits, from onesies to jackets to custom-made costumes. The energy
			of the crowd and the beauty of the music, combined with the overall feeling
			of connection between everyone was beautiful. In my opinion, any Sonic fan
			who can should definetly experience a Sonic Symphony concert!
			<br />
			<br />
			Thanks if you took the time to read all of this! I caught about 95% of the
			concert on video (with 5% battery to spare ), so once I get that uploaded to
			Dropbox I will link it below so you can see what the concert was like!
