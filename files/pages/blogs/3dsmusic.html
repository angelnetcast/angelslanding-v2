		<h1>How To Get Music From a 3DS Game</h1>
		<h3>(Or just decrypt 3DS roms in general)</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Disclaimer: </b>This guide is mostly for me so I remember what I did to
			replicate it later, but I’m deciding to post it because I had a hell of a
			time trying to figure it out in the first place. With that in mind, please
			exercise caution if you try this out! Since it’s for me, the guide is written
			as if you have some base idea of what you’re doing. I can try to help with
			anything if you email me, but if you break something I’m not responsible. ^^”
			Read everything through first, then follow the guide!
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a combination of multiple guides I used to get to this point, so I
			will link the originals in order in case you want to go to the source
			material. They have beginner-friendly step-by-step instructions.

		<h2>What you Need</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A modded 3DS to dump the game file <i>or</i> .3ds/.cia file of your desired
				game
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://vgmstream.org/">vgmstream</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases">CTRTool</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I did this on a laptop running Windows 11. You will need to use the command
			line with this method.
		</p>

		<h2>Guide</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Dumping a ROM</h3>
		<p>
			Getting the game files from your physical 3DS cart! You can get them from
			home menu software too, but I’m not including that because I haven’t gotten
			it to work.
			<a
				href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges#dumping-an-installed-title"
				>Check the 3DS hacks guide for more info on dumping installed software</a
			>. <mark>If you already have your game file, move on to part 2.</mark>
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Launch GodMode9</li>
			<li>Go to [C:] GAMECART</li>
			<li>Select the .trim.3ds file option</li>
			<li>Copy to 0:/gm9/out</li>
			<li>Power off your system and put your SD card into your computer</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to /gm9/out on the SD and copy the .trim.3ds file to your desired
				location
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Part 2: Decrypting the ROM</h3>
		<p>
			This decrypts the game file to show the contents. Doesn’t work for .nds
			files, but does work for .cia or .3ds.
			<mark
				>Note that CTRTool only works on x64-bit OS, you can find out if you have
				this in your system settings.</mark
			>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Download CTRTool</li>
			<li>
				Unzip the download and move ctrtool.exe to the same folder path as your game
				file
			</li>
			<li>
				Rename the game file to the name of your game (or whatever you want, this
				just makes it easier to type into the command line)
			</li>
			<li>Right-click in file explorer and hit open in terminal</li>
			<li>Run this command</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>.3ds:</b> ctrtool.exe --romfsdir=romfs GAMENAMEHERE.3ds</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you get a “Windows does not run from current location” error, add .\ in
						front of the command.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					<b>.cia:</b> ctrtool.exe --contents=contents game.cia then ctrtool.exe
					--romfsdir=romfs contents.0000.00000000
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						For some reason, you can also do this by changing the file extension from
						the first command .3ds to .cia. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Your game gets exported to a folder with all the files! All done!</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Part 3: Converting .bcstm to .wav</h3>
		<p>
			Let's get that music you’ve been waiting for in a format the silly little
			computer likes to read!
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Download vgmstream</li>
			<li>Unzip the folder and put it somewhere safe</li>
			<li>Go to where your .bcstm file is</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you just decrypted the rom, most games have their music in /sound/stream
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>
				Select your desired file and drag it to hover over the vgmstream-cli.exe
				file
			</li>
			<li>
				When the popup option says open with vgmstream-cli.exe, let go and the
				program will run the conversion
			</li>
			<li>
				Go back to where you dragged your .bcstm file from and look for your new
				.wav file
			</li>
			<li>Play the .wav in your desired music player!</li>
		</ol>
