				sooooo. remember how last entry i said my meds weren't working. turns out
				they were doing that silly side effect that just makes ur original symptoms
				worse instead of actually fixing the issue! how fun!! but i stopped taking
				them and i already feel a <b>lot</b> better. i'll have a dicussion soon for
				my next swap of meds, but for now we are back 2 default settings lol. i'll
				prooobably (maybe) talk about my experience w antidepressants later in an
				actual blog post but for the moment, i'm feeling more like myself :)
			</p>
			<p>
				since i am feeling better, i'll probably work on the site some more tonight!

				in other news,
				<u>steam's family sharing finally came out of beta!!</u> sharing a bunch of
				games w my friends now so that's pretty cool.

				it back up! i also have access to p3 reload and guilty gear strive so that's
				cool. my computer def cannot run those but its still nice 2 have access.

				hiiii i don't have much to say as of late. i've been getting into
				volunteering at an animal rescue organization's events regularly, and it's
				been a lot of fun hanging out with the cats for a few hours. i held hands
				with one yesterday and that was cool :) i was surprised she was chill with
				it lol. i also got a lot of gifts from my internship today, specifically
				<b

					<span class="caption" title="haribo gummy bears and happy cherries"
						>GUMMY BEARS</span
					>
					AND 3 CARTONS OF MINUTE MAID JUICES.</b

				which is <i>insane</i> cause i wasn't expecting it. they had sent us an
				email asking us our favorites and then delivered some CRAZY amounts of stuff
				which was really nice.
			</p>
			<p>
				i really wanna work on the site some more but my meds are <b>not</b> working
				as of late lol (that's a whole new thing i may talk about later) but i don't
				have any energy to code but i really want to work on it... something will
				happen soon hopefully! or i'll get new meds!! we'll see!!!

				if you're not new here, you might remember the
				<span class="caption" title="it was something like that"
					>"pls give me 600 dollars so i can make a sega dreamcast blog for u
					all"</span
				>
				marquee at the top of my "about me" page. WELL. IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED!!
				<u>I BOUGHT A DREAMCAST TODAY!!</u> i'm soooo fucking excited actually. i
				was originally going to get one last summer, but i ended up getting a PS5
				instead because my teachers convinced me that a dreamcast wasn't any fun and
				didn't have good games. tbh, idk why i even listened to them because
				<b>i had done my research beforehand...</b> i already knew what i wanted to
				play (games like sa2, space channel 5, chu chu rocket, seaman...) and that i
				would likely enjoy it. oh well! it's okay because i have one now YIPPEE ∩(
				✧Д✧)∩
			</p>

			<p>
				originally i was going to get this ebay listing with a boxed hello kitty
				blue edition dreamcast <i>(which is sooooo pretty btw)</i> but i ended up
				just getting this one bc $100 is a lot less than +$600 and i really only
				wanted the hk one for the looks and the keyboard.
				<u>any dreamcast will play games!</u> i won't be able to test it until i get
				home at the end of the month, provided i find some way to keep it safe on
				the plane.
			</p>

			<p>
				<i>buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut</i> not only did i get a dreamcast i got an NES!!!!
				(funded by my parents thank you o7) idk if they bought it to help me with my
				collection or for nostalgia (or both) but <b>WE WIN REGARDLESS!</b> i'm
				gonna keep an eye out for contra to get for them to play as thanks :) they
				love that game lol. i also got super mario bros + duck hunt for the nes and
				mario kart 64 while i was out. an eventful shopping day indeed (￣ﾛ￣;)

				hellooooo first entry of the month yay! i would've done one yesterday but i
				was <i>dead tired</i> after the <b>kikuo concert</b> i went to! (✩ ์ ᴗ ์✩)
				it was like a crazy rave but i had a lot of fun. it did rain the entire
				first half though, which would've been fine but it was an
				<u>outdoor concert</u>. i have a personal grudge against water, avoid it
				<i>whenever</i> i can, so this was a bit annoying щ(ﾟДﾟщ) luckily, it wasn't
				heavy rain... i did buy some merch while i was there tho! i spent
				<b>65 usd</b> (ouch) on a kikuo world t-shirt and sticker pack which i'm
				pretty happy about :3 i was on the fence about spending so much money but
				then i thought to myself,
				<u
					>"this is a once in a lifetime experience and good chance to get kikuo
					merch, so buy that tshirt!!!"</u
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>today was my last day of break</b>, i have tomorrow off too but i have 2
				fly back to school so my day is mostly transit. not to mention i have to
				wake up super early to go to the doctor and have a psych appt b4 i go back
				to school... eugh. i don't mind either, i'd just rather go when my brain is
				<u>actually working</u>.
			</p>
			<p>
				on my first day home i had to get my hair washed and random people came to
				my house. they had a little girl who was absolutely
				<b>hacking up a lung</b> and the coughs were so wet i wished she'd leave- my
				germ cautiousness was stronger than usual from being paranoid about the
				plane the previous day. plus she kept pointing a
				<span
					class="caption"
					title="no one else seems to find them painful but me, so i hate getting shot with one (￣ﾛ￣;)"
					>nerf gun</span
				>
				at me. she certainly kept me on edge.
			</p>
			<p>
				on the second day of break i had to get my hair rebraided, + the kikuo
				concert after. i had a splitting headache because my hair was braided
				<b>so tightly</b>. my mom asked for it to be looser but the lady said "it is
				already so loose!" <b><i>AND KEPT GOING!!!</i></b> (ʘ言ʘ╬) i had trouble
				getting to sleep that night because just touching my scalp hurt (_　_|||)
			</p>
			<p>
				today, i spent most of my day writing the new
				<a href="/pages/shrines/shera.html">she-ra</a> shrine. content-wise, it's my
				<u>first finished shrine in site history! yay!!</u> i also watched castle in
				the sky and finished the second half of spirited away. castle in the sky
				pissed me off bc it was sooo pretty but reminded me of how terrible people
				can be. that "king of laputa" guy was <b>so annoying!!!</b> animation
				remains unbeated as my favorite artistic medium though. after my ghibli
				rewatches i watched a bunch of video essays. those were good as well, but
				throughout the entire day i was plagued by some kind of crazy
				<b>pulsing headache</b> that just would NOT go away.maybe it's bc i forgot
				to take my antidepressants for a few days (oops), lack of hydration, both,
				neither, who knows. the last of my paychecks from my summer job came in
				today so i have more money now. so who cares!
