		<h1>angel's diary</h1>
		<p>
			i talk about my life and try not to overshare lol. not very interesting, but
			it's a good way for me to remember what's happening day-to-day.

		<p>
			some things may require content warnings, which will be listed at the top of
			the entry. had to add this disclaimer because i may talk about world events
			and that's a little sucky... anything before 2025 is safe though!
