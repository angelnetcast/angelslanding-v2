        been going to college tours this week, i'm on fall break. this isn't a new thing for me, but i'm actually really intrigued
        by the college i went to this morning. i wont say which college, but i've been on dozens of tours and
        <b>this is the first one where i actually saw myself going here in the future!!</b>
        so for now, it's knocked itself up to my top choice.
        <i>(which wasn't that hard, i didn't really have an opinion before...)</i> in the car headed to the next college so we'll
        see what happens!
