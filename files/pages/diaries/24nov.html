				<u>loooong time no see! （*＾ワ＾*）ノ</u> i probably won't have this
				uploaded to my site until i push v2, but it's nice to write anyway! (-v-)
				i've finally gotten on meds that seem to work most of the time, so i've been
				working on the site over the last while. i really miss the personality of
				older versions so we're <b>going back!</b> (finally, as promised?) as of rn,
				aside from graphics the home page is mostly done, esp layout wise. i want to
				do something <i>windows 7</i> themed for my about page, but i'm not so sure
				if i can get that done in time. i totally <i>could,</i> but there's always
				the other variables in life to worry about.
			</p>
			<p>
				in other news, <u>i've finished all my college applications!</u> i've been
				accepted into most of them, including the ones i actually want to go to. i
				won't hear back from my reach schools for a while, but i'm def going to
				college at least. even if it ends up i can't afford where i want to go, i
				have a few full rides/full tuitions set to the side if necessary. in any
				other situation i would just go where the money goes, but because i found
				some schools i'm genuinely interested in (and get in-state tuition at), i
				really want to reach for those.

				videogame time! i played like<span

					title="a bit of an exaggeration">
					5 mins</span
				>
				of sxsg so far. not for disliking it, i was just not having a good day at
				the time. (⎻▵ ⎻) i hope i can play more soon!
				<br />
				i did get guilty gear strive to run on my laptop, yippee! my bf sent me a
				potato mod that absolutely <i>decimates</i> the backgrounds in the game, but
				hey it's playable. (comparison photos here when i remember) i currently main
				ramlethal valentine because fun! i love her swords and funny poses and she
				looks very cool.
				<br />
				as of today, i've played all of mouthwashing (which i really liked), and
				<b>10+ hours</b> of cult of the lamb (mostly gained in two days) cult of the
				lamb is like
				<span
					class="caption"
					title="the binding of issac specifically. my bf got me to try it and i gave it like 2 hours before i gave up o7 i'm shit at it"
					>issac</span
				>
				that doesn't want you dead so i loved it. and its soooo cute! running a cult
				is pretty fun...
