				happy after christmas! here's the post santa day update from me. most
				importantly, <b>i got a new ipad and apple pencil!!!</b> unfortunately
				they're not compatible... (10th gen and pro pencil) but my mom says we can
				go and trade the 10th gen for an air. it'll lose half the storage but be
				more powerful... my current ipad (6th gen) is kicking the bucket despite my
				great care of it for years. it often crashes in the middle of me drawing,
				and i can't have too many apps open at once without serious lag.
				<i>even procreate and spotify at the same time is a no-go!</i> consequently,
				i'm <u>super hyped</u> for a new ipad. i'll be turning off icloud photo sync
				(fuck that thing) and most other apple stuff. on that note, i've exported
				all of my art as .procreate to the files app. yippee! but i cant get it onto
				dropbox or something >:/ done yapping cause i actually wanna code now lol
				byebye!

				haiiiiii
				<br />
				<b>guess who's finished their capstone project!</b> o(≧∇≦o) my group has
				submitted our final things and are awaiting our grading, changes that need
				to be made, etc...
			</p>
			<p>
				the capstone project is basically an assignment that's the last thing i have
				to do (academic work wise) for my <i>entire high school career</i>. i'm
				done!!!!! yippee!!!!!!!!! okay not technically, we still have some
				presentations to do and such. but fabrication and documentation are done. my
				project was basically an excuse to make
				<u>a pc and fightstick controllers lol,</u>
				it's pretty dope. it also runs way better than my laptop which is kinda jank
				cause its in this dumbass wood case but whatever...
			</p>
			<p>
				now that i do not have classes i have to decide what i'm gonna do. i still
				have commitments w the school but my afternoons are free. i picked to get
				dismissed early, and i think i'll get a job and work on the site and
				learning blender in my off days. <u>the fishabilities are endfish!</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				christmas break is in a week, so i'll be doing a shark tank pitch to my
				parents when i get home. i'm finally ready to <b>get back into art!</b> i
				have some ideas for small things like stickers and keychains, and i'm
				excited to start on that for a side project.
			</p>
			<p>
				i'm tired now expect me to do things... later. i need recharge time lol

			<p>
				so here's a pro tip from the cyberspace angel. you probably should take ur
				antidepressants regularly... lol. do not be like me and periodically miss a
				day o-O i've been finding recently i'm <i>heavily</i> dependent on my
				schedules. when i'm at school, everything happens at the same time so it's
				much easier for me to do everything at the same time. when i'm at home,
				static stuff like me waking up and going to sleep becomes much more
				variable. it throws everything off, and i end up missing stuff like brushing
				teeth, showering, and eating a loooot more than i should. also i forget to
				take my meds. but those are a relatively new addition to my routine. -_-
			</p>
			<p>
				all in all, mental health is weird. it feels like everyday i'm either
				feeling crazy good or crazy bad. i hate when my mood is so variable, bc it
				messes up my plans on what to do every day TwT. but we're working on it bit
				by bit o7

				hello! time for the end-of-year <b>life update</b>! （˶′◡‵˶）i had a nice
				birthday and thanksgiving, i spent the former with a friend and the latter
				with family. i do not get to see my extended family often, so i was
				<u>very happy</u> to see my cousins, aunts, and uncles!
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because of the food!!</i> despite it
				not liking me very much, U~U i <b>love</b> my mom's cooking and happily
				await the turkey and special punch headed my way. this year i didn't get any
				though, because my family organized an event where everyone contributed a
				dish. my mom made a red velvet cake (which i didn't eat because i don't like
				buttercream? icing). i was really exited for turkey, and put some on my
				plate along with mac n cheese and corn on the cob. i sat with some of my
				cousins, and excitedly took a bite... only to finally realize why many of my
				friends did not like turkey. <u>this tasted terrible. legitimately.</u> the
				turkey was <i>super</i> dry and it coated my mouth like chalk.
				<b>i was so dissapointed!</b> ╥﹏╥ everything else was decent though. i
				certainly missed my mom's cooking in that moment, but i was happy to spend
				some time with family.
			</p>
			<p>
				one of the highlights of my thanksgiving trip was the market i went to! my
				aunt took me to this store tucked away in a shopping center that advertised
				anime figures. i had like
				<span
					class="caption"
					title="due to a mishap with a school project and made worse by people not submitting paperwork to refund me"
					>$2.38 to my name</span
				>
				and wasn't planning on buying anything (unless i saw rei ayanami or an eva
				build kit ofc). but once we walked inside and wandered a bit, i found
				<b>the best thing ever</b>. <u>retro video game stores!!!!!</u> i won't
				<span
					class="caption"
					title="or maybe you'd be interested idk, you are on neocities... i'd be happy to elaborate more to anyone who asks!! i love yapping about videogames"
					>bore you with the details</span
				>, but i ended up purchasing a handful of games! i got
				<i>my first dreamcast game</i>, and 3 nes titles. i've been keeping an eye
				out for specific dc games, and i was super lucky to find
				<b>space channel 5</b> while sorting through bins ( ✧Д✧). for the nes, i got
				kirby's adventure for myself, paperboy for my mom, and the legend of zelda
				for my dad. i'm excited to go home and test them out!
