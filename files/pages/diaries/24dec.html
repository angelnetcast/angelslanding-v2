        hello! time for the end-of-year <b>life update</b>! （˶′◡‵˶）i had a nice birthday and thanksgiving, i spent the former
        with a friend and the latter with family. i do not get to see my extended family often, so i was <u>very happy</u> to see
        my cousins, aunts, and uncles!
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because of the food!!</i> despite it not liking me very much, U~U i <b>love</b> my
        mom's cooking and happily await the turkey and special punch headed my way. this year i didn't get any though, because my
        family organized an event where everyone contributed a dish. my mom made a red velvet cake (which i didn't eat because i
        don't like buttercream? icing). i was really exited for turkey, and put some on my plate along with mac n cheese and corn
        on the cob. i sat with some of my cousins, and excitedly took a bite... only to finally realize why many of my friends did
        not like turkey. <u>this tasted terrible. legitimately.</u> the turkey was <i>super</i> dry and it coated my mouth like
        chalk. <b>i was so dissapointed!</b> ╥﹏╥ everything else was decent though. i certainly missed my mom's cooking in that
        moment, but i was happy to spend some time with family.
      </p>
      <p>
        one of the highlights of my thanksgiving trip was the market i went to! my aunt took me to this store tucked away in a
        shopping center that advertised anime figures. i had like
        <span
          class="caption"
          title="due to a mishap with a school project and made worse by people not submitting paperwork to refund me"
          >$2.38 to my name</span
        >
        and wasn't planning on buying anything (unless i saw rei ayanami or an eva build kit ofc). but once we walked inside and
        wandered a bit, i found <b>the best thing ever</b>. <u>retro video game stores!!!!!</u> i won't
        <span
          class="caption"
          title="or maybe you'd be interested idk, you are on neocities... i'd be happy to elaborate more to anyone who asks!! i love yapping about videogames"
          >bore you with the details</span
        >, but i ended up purchasing a handful of games! i got <i>my first dreamcast game</i>, and 3 nes titles. i've been keeping
        an eye out for specific dc games, and i was super lucky to find <b>space channel 5</b> while sorting through bins ( ✧Д✧).
        for the nes, i got kirby's adventure for myself, paperboy for my mom, and the legend of zelda for my dad. i'm excited to
        go home and test them out!
