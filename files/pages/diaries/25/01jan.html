							here but i think if i have enough to say it would be better suited to be
							a blog entry. i traveled to china once when i was little and this app is
							just reminding me of all the stuff i miss from there lol.
						</p>

						<p>
							in other news, i've narrowed my college choices down to two options. the
							reason i haven't picked yet is because one of these colleges has the best
							campus and dorms ever, and the other has the acutal majors i want to
							take. damn. also the latter one is more expensive. i think i'll just go
							for it and double major in cybersecurity and game design so i have a "wow
							i can afford to live" skill and a "wow i engage in my hobbies and don't
							want to kms" skill. if that makes sense.
						</p>
						<p>
							everything is so stressful rn but i just keep telling myself it'll all
							turn out okay in the end. i don't really believe that it will, i've never
							been an optimist, but that's all i can do rn. at least if i fuck it up i
							have a safety net but i'm worried about my friends that don't and i feel
							like a spoiled brat for the situation i'm in. life would be so awesome if
							i was just a housecat or a computer. i'd love to just be an android and i
							could shut off for a while and just come back when i feel ready. i don't
							know how much more of this i can take aaaaaaaaaa,, but as always we lock
							in. i'll fucking make it. i know i will because if i don't then i've done
							all of this for nothing. and i am going to make something of myself
							despite all of the things that try to stop me. people always say life is
							worth living, and i want to feel that too. determination yay!

							to end on a lighter note, why is gender so ugh. i put a poll in a server
							with some friends and only 5 others understand what i'm getting at...
							real ones o7 i know this is contradictory so just bear with me here.

								poll results for the question "which would you rather be", and the

							gets elected into office. like i know i feel <i>bad</i> about it but my

							"there are only two genders" bs which is major erasure of trans and
							intersex ppl, or just anyone who doesn't identify as m/f (duh). feeling
							hopeless as this country becomes a less and less safe place for me every

							soooooo. hear about the switch two yet? yes? great. anyway, here's my
							opinion on it like everyone and their mom hasn't already shared their
							thoughts.
						</p>
						<p>
							initial impression: meh. it's the switch but souped up, about what i
							expected
						</p>
						<p>concerns:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								they got rid of the joycon color??? that was the only personality u had
								man this is basically a steam deck now
							</li>
							<li>
								i personally never had issue with the original stand being finnicky, but
								i'm not blind. this stand is much better
							</li>
							<li>backwards compatibility fuck yeaaaaaah</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							things that would make me actually buy it at launch (cause i'm not fuckin
							doing that my current switch is fine):
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>streetpass returns</li>
							<li>splatoon themed console</li>
							<li>tomodachi life 2</li>
							<li>switch 2 only splatoon game</li>
							<li>
								miis and themes are integrated (with miitopia mii editor as default)
							</li>
							<li>
								animal crossing that Isn't Shit and Acutally Fun (just make the
								villagers mean again pleaseeeee)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							all of these things have weight to them, so just because one is true
							doesn't mean i'm immediately boarding the switch 2 train. ex: they make
							an exclusive splatoon game then i'm getting one asap vs they only put
							splatoon themed console out, i can get that later.
						</p>
						<p>
							final verdict: doesn't look too bad, but since my current switch works
							(mostly) just fine and i don't have a job or a real reason to get a new
							switch, i won't be getting one for a while unless something absolutely
							bananas bonkers happens

							happy new year everypony, goodbye 2014 hello 2015 x3
							<br />
							i feel about the same everyday, so i don't feel much different about the
							new year (except i'm really sleepy) but i'm anticipating my plans for the
							new year.
						</p>
						<p>those plans are:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>start a small business (sticker shop!)</li>

							</li>
							<li>improve my art</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									focus on distinguising different animal species and breeds in my
									artstyle
								</li>
								<li>learn perspective and lighting</li>
								<li>learn scenes and backgrounds</li>
								<li>learn proper anatomy (so i can stylize it consistently ofc)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>make any videogame at all!</li>
							<li>get back into making music</li>
							<li>learn how to 3d model</li>
							<li>finish/add some site pages</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									add: angel's kitchen, angel's travels, the <i>extensive</i> video game
									collection, more shrines, plushie collection, fashion page and more...
									(big plans :3)
								</li>
								<li>finish: shrines, art, music</li>
							</ul>
							<li>make more ftu layouts</li>
							<li>make some penpals</li>
							<li>make digital copies of my dvd collection</li>
							<li>jailbreak the xboxes</li>
							<li>learn to solder</li>
						</ul>
						<p>

							get to eventually (and some new things) but i hope those reading that are
							interested will stick around to see me accomplish what i can :3 cheers!
