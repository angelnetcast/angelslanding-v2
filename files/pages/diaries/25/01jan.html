				soooooo. hear about the switch two yet? yes? great. anyway, here's my
				opinion on it like everyone and their mom hasn't already shared their
				thoughts.
			</p>
			<p>
				initial impression: meh. it's the switch but souped up, about what i
				expected
			</p>
			<p>concerns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					they got rid of the joycon color??? that was the only personality u had man
					this is basically a steam deck now
				</li>
				<li>
					i personally never had issue with the original stand being finnicky, but
					i'm not blind. this stand is much better
				</li>
				<li>backwards compatibility fuck yeaaaaaah</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				things that would make me actually buy it at launch (cause i'm not fuckin
				doing that my current switch is fine):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>streetpass returns</li>
				<li>splatoon themed console</li>
				<li>tomodachi life 2</li>
				<li>switch 2 only splatoon game</li>
				<li>
					miis and themes are integrated (with miitopia mii editor as default)
				</li>
				<li>
					animal crossing that Isn't Shit and Acutally Fun (just make the villagers
					mean again pleaseeeee)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				all of these things have weight to them, so just because one is true doesn't
				mean i'm immediately boarding the switch 2 train. ex: they make an exclusive
				splatoon game then i'm getting one asap vs they only put splatoon themed
				console out, i can get that later.
			</p>
			<p>final verdict: doesn't look too bad, but since my current switch works (mostly) just fine and i don't have a job or a real reason to get a new switch, i won't be getting one for a while unless something absolutely bananas bonkers happens</p>

				happy new year everypony, goodbye 2014 hello 2015 x3
				<br />
				i feel about the same everyday, so i don't feel much different about the new
				year (except i'm really sleepy) but i'm anticipating my plans for the new
				year.
			</p>
			<p>those plans are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>start a small business (sticker shop!)</li>
				<li>open my commissions again</li>
				<li>
					do more art trades <b>(if u see this and wanna trade email me!!!)</b>
				</li>
				<li>improve my art</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						focus on distinguising different animal species and breeds in my artstyle
					</li>
					<li>learn perspective and lighting</li>
					<li>learn scenes and backgrounds</li>
					<li>learn proper anatomy (so i can stylize it consistently ofc)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>make any videogame at all!</li>
				<li>get back into making music</li>
				<li>learn how to 3d model</li>
				<li>finish/add some site pages</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						add: angel's kitchen, angel's travels, the <i>extensive</i> video game
						collection, more shrines, plushie collection, fashion page and more...
						(big plans :3)
					</li>
					<li>finish: shrines, art, music</li>
				</ul>
				<li>make more ftu layouts</li>
				<li>make some penpals</li>
				<li>make digital copies of my dvd collection</li>
				<li>jailbreak the xboxes</li>
				<li>learn to solder</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				ok that's just a super long list of things i've mostly been planning to get
				to eventually (and some new things) but i hope those reading that are
