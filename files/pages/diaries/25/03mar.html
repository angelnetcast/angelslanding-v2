				prom this weekend ughhhhhhh.... hopefully i get to hang out with my bf the
				day before, i wanna play tekken lol. apparently i wasn't clear that i didn't
				want to go to prom to my parents o~o i thought that was understood. i
				literally never go to dances. i went to the first highschool dance, decided
				it was mid, and only went to any subsequent dances if i was asked to.
				this'll be the third dance of my highschool career (and the last thank god).
				i think an unnessesary amount of emphasis is put on this one event but no
				hate to the people who like dressing up and socializing, it's just not for
				me :p
			</p>
			<p>
				i was playing splatoon series yesterday (super surprising ik) and bro. this
				is like a group project i don't get to choose my partners. i usually don't
				play online if i'm playing splatoon cause i have the most fun with my
				teammates, we're pretty synced up imo. but everyone says i should get out of
				c- rank because i usually play in s+ lobbies i just don't level myself up
				there. so i decide to take some initiative and play by myself..
				<u
					>and this absolute dipshit with a brain of rocks is playing ranked series
					like its turf. <b>LOCK IN!!!!!</b></u
				>
				apparently this is how ranked players feel all the time but its not for me
				man. i'm gonna go play side order again -_- (this is the code from that game
				btw if u wanna watch it, the guy playing turf is named :3
				RKGT-GHRM-M8PE-N5J4)
			</p>
			<p>
				anyway i have other things to do but the main reason i'm writing an entry
				today is i wanted to say i think my meds are working!! (which i mentioned
				last entry and i forgor lol) i was singing risk by mega mango (really good
				song btw) and i finished it and i realized i didn't think "god i wish i
				didn't feel like this" at all during the song. i kinda don't feel like
				anything for a few days buuuuuuut.. progress. i'll take what i can get o7
			</p>
			<p>
				also i finished an animation but i'm too lazy to post it properly so
				<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/angelnetcast.com/post/3llcziqxk7k2v"
					>here</a

				lol

				small update: my team won that hackathon i mentioned before! we placed first
				so i get like 200 bucks which is <i>craaaazy</i>. when i joined i didn't
				even know we could win money i just wanted to make a website... ∑(ﾟ∇ﾟ|||)
				once the money comes in i can put it towards stuff for my room and the site!
			</p>
			<p>
				i got two commissions this month so i'm thinking about getting a domain!
				that'll create a whole issue with my webrings again tho, maybe i can figure
				out a redirect solution. :p i wanna try out csp but idk about using it on my
				ipad and my computer is too weak 4 it (i can't run medibang paint/firealpaca
				without lag -_-) i'm considering switching from procreate to csp but there
				are some issues w that.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					i don't have a screen tablet or a powerful enough computer to justify
					getting the puter version
				</li>
				<li>super brokies</li>
				<li>i dont wanna pay a subscription for the ipad version...</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				idk we will just have to see. 40 something days until i graduate high school
				wish me luck. gonna miss my friends and my boyfriend but other than that i
				don't wanna be hereeeeeee aaaaaaaaaaaaa ಠ_ಠ not to mention i have to go to
				prom instead of a local game competition (how typical of a neocities recluse
				to prefer splatoon to prom ik) i don't even want to go to prom i'm just
				going for my ??? mom??? parents??? family????? idk i wouldn't be going if i
				didn't have do. i don't like traditions like this. the possibility of
				winning the pool money once more has been stolen from my bf and i. tragic
				crime!!
			</p>
			<p>
				i think my meds are working cause i have a lot more thoughts like "wow i
				love my friends" and "wow its fun to be alive" "wow i appreciate all of my
				neoneighbors for being alive and creating" general flowery things like that.
				but as im writing this i am realizing those mfs wear offfffff. i am
				generally holding more love and kindness in my heart every day tho. i do my
				best. i will survive despite everything o7
			</p>
			<p>
				augh also i mentioned something on my site profile about writing an article
				but it kinda turned into a manifesto so idk if i'll finish it. i just got
				really pissed off about all the stuff being defunded and how the planet is
				going rn. not much i can do about that large scale ig, but i'll try to make
				community in my cities and mold a support system many people can benefit
				from. idk i'm rambling now so i'm probably gonna close vscodium for the
				night. RELIABLE NATIONWIDE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR EVERYONE RN. FUCK CARS.
				I WAS BUILT TO LOOK LOVINGLY OUT A TRAIN WINDOW LIKE A MOVIE CHARACTER.
