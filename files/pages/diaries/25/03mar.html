				small update: my team won that hackathon i mentioned before! we placed first
				so i get like 200 bucks which is <i>craaaazy</i>. when i joined i didn't
				even know we could win money i just wanted to make a website... ∑(ﾟ∇ﾟ|||)
				once the money comes in i can put it towards stuff for my room and the site!
			</p>
			<p>
				i got two commissions this month so i'm thinking about getting a domain!
				that'll create a whole issue with my webrings again tho, maybe i can figure
				out a redirect solution. :p i wanna try out csp but idk about using it on my
				ipad and my computer is too weak 4 it (i can't run medibang paint/firealpaca
				without lag -_-) i'm considering switching from procreate to csp but there
				are some issues w that.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					i don't have a screen tablet or a powerful enough computer to justify
					getting the puter version
				</li>
				<li>super brokies</li>
				<li>i dont wanna pay a subscription for the ipad version...</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				idk we will just have to see. 40 something days until i graduate high school
				wish me luck. gonna miss my friends and my boyfriend but other than that i
				don't wanna be hereeeeeee aaaaaaaaaaaaa ಠ_ಠ not to mention i have to go to
				prom instead of a local game competition (how typical of a neocities recluse
				to prefer splatoon to prom ik) i don't even want to go to prom i'm just
				going for my ??? mom??? parents??? family????? idk i wouldn't be going if i
				didn't have do. i don't like traditions like this. the possibility of
				winning the pool money once more has been stolen from my bf and i. tragic
				crime!!
			</p>
			<p>
				i think my meds are working cause i have a lot more thoughts like "wow i
				love my friends" and "wow its fun to be alive" "wow i appreciate all of my
				neoneighbors for being alive and creating" general flowery things like that.
				but as im writing this i am realizing those mfs wear offfffff. i am
				generally holding more love and kindness in my heart every day tho. i do my
				best. i will survive despite everything o7
			</p>
			<p>
				augh also i mentioned something on my site profile about writing an article
				but it kinda turned into a manifesto so idk if i'll finish it. i just got
				really pissed off about all the stuff being defunded and how the planet is
				going rn. not much i can do about that large scale ig, but i'll try to make
				community in my cities and mold a support system many people can benefit
				from. idk i'm rambling now so i'm probably gonna close vscodium for the
				night. RELIABLE NATIONWIDE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR EVERYONE RN. FUCK CARS.
				I WAS BUILT TO LOOK LOVINGLY OUT A TRAIN WINDOW LIKE A MOVIE CHARACTER.
