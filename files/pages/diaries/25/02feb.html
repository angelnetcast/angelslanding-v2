							i had a <u>great</u> today which was pleasantly surprising! woke up on
							the right side of the bed and spent the whole day upbeat and filled with
							love and kindness. it has been a <i>whiiiiile</i> since i had a day like
							this one :']
						</p>
						<p>
							i watched atlantis: the lost emperor with my friend today and my main
							takeaway is: disney puts their most attractive characters in that last
							batch of hand-drawn animation.
							<u>audrey rocio ramirez i swear i could give you the world.</u> and milo
							is what i would point at to say "my type" even though i generally don't
							have one. i was gonna elaborate and then i decided to keep it to myself
							lol. helga... you are so pretty but you know what you did.
						</p>
						<p>
							also i tried to give blood today. here's a silly little comic on how that
							went (since i haven't made one of those in a while)
						</p>

						<p>
							yes. she did actually say "girlll" which was <b>devastating</b>. can't
							say i didn't try though T-T

							hi! yesterday i traveled a bit to go to kamicon with my bf and had a ton
							of fun. we mostly stayed in the arcade and the artists alley the whole
							time, playing games and browsing. i ended up purchasing <i>5 things</i>,
							a new record! i got a princess luna keychain, a rei ayanami keychain, two
							rei ayanami prints, and a rei shirt.
							<u>i wonder who my favorite character is</u>.
						</p>
						<p>
							my favorite part of kami con continues to be <b>the arcade</b>.
							everything inside is free to play, and there's a huge variety of games.
							you can play fighting games,
							<span class="caption" title="my personal favorite">rhythm games,</span>
							dancing games, pinball, vr, retro consoles, and one game that was like
							simulating being a train conductor?? that one looked cool but i didn't
							have time to play it. i played tekken, guilty gear, bubble bobble, a
							handful of rhythm games
							<span
								class="caption"
								title="my bf and i bothed picked normal mode for our first songs, decided it was too easy, switched to hard, and immediately regretted our decision lmao. we played a cruel angel's thesis and calamari inkantation"
								>(including taiko no tatsujin, with the drums and everything)</span
							>, and jet grind radio. we watched a tekken tournament before we left and
							it was actually pretty exciting by the end.
						</p>
						<p>
							there were a ton of cool cosplays at the con. i spent the whole time
							pointing out characters i recognized and my bf played where's waldo
							trying to find them lol. i sort of cosplayed as parappa the rapper,
							because i bought his hat and wore an outfit vaguely resembling his. 6
							people recognized me though, so i win B) the coolest cosplay i saw was
							this guy dressed up as the prince from katamari damacy. he competed in a
							katamari tournament they were holding but idr if he won or not lol.

							unrelated but i started playing pokemon sleep and pikmin bloom. they're
							fun! acpcc collection efforts are going along o7
