				hi! yesterday i traveled a bit to go to kamicon with my bf and had a ton of
				fun. we mostly stayed in the arcade and the artists alley the whole time,
				playing games and browsing. i ended up purchasing <i>5 things</i>, a new
				record! i got a princess luna keychain, a rei ayanami keychain, two rei
				ayanami prints, and a rei shirt.
				<u>i wonder who my favorite character is</u>.
			</p>
			<p>
				my favorite part of kami con continues to be <b>the arcade</b>. everything
				inside is free to play, and there's a huge variety of games. you can play
				fighting games,
				<span class="caption" title="my personal favorite">rhythm games,</span>
				dancing games, pinball, vr, retro consoles, and one game that was like
				simulating being a train conductor?? that one looked cool but i didn't have
				time to play it. i played tekken, guilty gear, bubble bobble, a handful of
				rhythm games
				<span
					class="caption"
					title="my bf and i bothed picked normal mode for our first songs, decided it was too easy, switched to hard, and immediately regretted our decision lmao. we played a cruel angel's thesis and calamari inkantation"
					>(including taiko no tatsujin, with the drums and everything)</span
				>, and jet grind radio. we watched a tekken tournament before we left and it
				was actually pretty exciting by the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				there were a ton of cool cosplays at the con. i spent the whole time
				pointing out characters i recognized and my bf played where's waldo trying
				to find them lol. i sort of cosplayed as parappa the rapper, because i
				bought his hat and wore an outfit vaguely resembling his. 6 people
				recognized me though, so i win B) the coolest cosplay i saw was this guy
				dressed up as the prince from katamari damacy. he competed in a katamari
				tournament they were holding but idr if he won or not lol.
