							<b><u>HAPPY FUCKING JUNETEENTH EVERYBODY!!!!!!</u></b> i got to attend my first juneteenth celebration today in galveston! for those unaware, galveston was the last place to recieve the news that african-americans were free, despite the emancipation proclamation being released two years prior. juneteenth celebrations originated here and now today is recognized as a federal holiday :]

                        <p>
                        i'll be talking about some of the highlights of places i visited in my travel log at some point (like the train musem which was super cool btw!!), but i had the most fun at the juneteenth parade. most of my life i've felt like i have a disconnect with other black ppl but that's why i enjoy events like this so much more. black joy is such a beautiful thing to me bc despite all of the hardships we face we still find joy and community in each other. also i got a lot of candy from the parade :3 after the parade, a lady told us about free crawfish and catfish being given out down the street so we stopped by. this was my first time trying crawfish actually, so the party environment was even more special to me. (it was a little spicy and i didn't rlly like peeling the little guys apart, so overall crawfish are on the <span class="caption" title="i don't dislike them but i prefer them preshelled. i'm weird about getting food on my hands">same level as shrimp with the tail still on them</span> to me)
                        </p>

                        <p>idk man i just had a lot of fun sharing community with others and celebrating. happy juneteenth!!! :3</p>
