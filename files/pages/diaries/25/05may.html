							what retail does to a mf. i don't rlly like my job, it't not bad or
							anything, retail just isn't my thing. its so booooooringgg.
							<u
								>i don't wanna market an outfit to you, i want to set up your
								network!!!!</u
							>
							i want to go back to my internship. ngl if i could just do that kind of
							work for the rest of my life i'd be chilling. i love networking and
							computers i do NOT like standing around... the clothes are cute but i do
							not get enough shifts to afford anything anyway. the things i do for a
							few bucks. sigh. i'm ngl i might need another job cause i can't buy shit
							but literally no one wants to hire me!!! "we need employees" my ass- (on
							that note i will draw for money just a reminder...)
						</p>
						<p>
							been on my kendrick arc for the past week or so cause spotify kept
							dropping random songs into my playlist cause i kept listening to 30 for
							30 and luther. i've always liked a handful of kendrick songs but i'm
							gonna have to listen to a full album at some point. him and sza are
							cooking full course meals on their collab tracks omfg... i wish i could
							get the feeling i had listening to all the stars during the black panther
							movie's credits back.

								title="a looooot of ppl ik iat school were into marvel and kept spoiling things to me but since i'd never seen a marvel movie or knew anything about superheroes (other than teen titans) the whole franchise was pretty much left unsullied for me"
								>that was the first marvel movie i'd seen and it got me really excited
								to finally get into marvel and see what i was missing.</span
							>
							very unfortunate to get into marvel and then everything past endgame be
							shit -v-. i don't have much to say about most of the marvel properties
							but my favs have always been black panther and guardians of the galaxy.
							rocket my beloved. if only u knew how cool u are (he definitely
							does lol)

							<b>i'm officially hired!</b> this will be my first retail job, and i
							start tomorrow. onboarding was today and all of my managers seemed really
							nice so i think it will be okay. luckily, i'm starting before the summer
							rush so i should have a slow environment to learn in.
						</p>
						<p>
							i've been going back into my techy yt rabbit hole and god i wish i knew
							everything rn. i really hope i can learn javascript by the end of the
							summer, i'd like to have at least one scripting language under my belt. i
							wanna make videogames!!! and i wanna write random scripts to make stuff
							easier for me... aughhhh i wanna know Everything right Now
						</p>
						<p>
							i reeeeeally wanna buy

							as of a few days ago, i'm officially a <b>high-school graduate</b>! it's
							quite nice to be moved out of my dorm and back around all of my stuff.
							though i didn't realize that people give you money so now i have more
							money than i know what to do with???? this isn't counting the money i
							saved up from my job last year. maybe i can build a pc but honestly i
							should probably focus on a stronger laptop. people keep asking me how i
							feel about graduating, but honestly there isn't much to say. i feel the
							same as i do all the time, just like on my birthday. i'll be starting
							college in the fall so... new things are on the way?
						</p>
						<p>
							as for my high school performance, i graduated with a pretty good act
							score and gpa and some ap classes under my belt. i think i did well but i
							can say that i didn't waste all of my teen years for perfect grades which
							is what i really wanted.
						</p>
						<p>
							i have a job interview set up for this week! hopefully i get a job...
							that way i can save all of the graduation money and last year money. i'll
							use whatever i get now for fleshing out my console collection and
							fixing/setting up various things around the house (ex: craft center,
							broken consoles, ethernet)
						</p>
						<p>
							about the craft center, since joann fabrics is going out of buisness i
							went to buy some things on sale. i got some scrapbook paper and clothing
							patterns! i remembered i have a sewing machine, so i'm gonna try to make
							a swimsuit. i hate buying them from stores cause they're always either
							<u>expensive, ugly, or both</u>. this way i can choose my fabric and
							pattern and make something i actually like!!! if this goes well, i may
							make a fashion page to document more clothes i make. we'll see...
						</p>
						<p>
							now that i'm home, i have a few things i want to do. i really want to
							learn soldering to homebrew the rest of my consoles, and begin setting up
							a homelab. once i get more progress on that i'll probably make a page
							about it too. at the very least, i want to get my plex server working
							correctly and rip all of my dvds/blurays. maybe i'll get a nas...?
