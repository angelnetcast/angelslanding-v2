						hiii! i was sick over the weekend >-< no clue with what but i seem to be
						mostly recovered now. we're down to a little cough and a runny nose o7
						weekend kinda sucked bc i was in a terrible mental state over scholarship
						essays but i've locked in. been cleaning my room and doing laundry this
						afternoon and i feel a lot better. i've also been getting excited about
						college and the summer, because <u>i graduate in three weeks!</u> i have
						plans to work part time and tackle some creative projects so hopefully
						that goes how i want it to. also entirely unrelated but obsidian is kinda
						fire, i've been using it to revive the world of the book i wrote in
						elementary school. graph view my beloved...
