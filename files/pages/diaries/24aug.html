				hi!!!!!!!!!!!!! morning entry cause i'll be taking flights home from school
				today, and won't be stationary until past 10pm at the earliest (￣ﾛ￣;)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>first month of my senior year pretty much over with atp,</b> and i'm not
				feeling too bad! once we get back from labor day break we get to go to our
				internships and don't have to sit in the school cafeteria (and the
				sweltering heat outside (＃｀д´)ﾉ) anymore!!! hooray!! we get our
				assignments later today so i'm excited to see what i get :)
			</p>
			<p>
				we did senior sunrise this morning and it was actually
				<i>so much fun!!</i> not specifically the sunrise part tho, my friends and i
				went out to a diner for breakfast before school since we were up so early-
				there is <b>no way</b> i'm getting up at 5am again any time soon -v- i got
				french toast and it is actually the <u>3rd best</u> i've had in my life (i
				still need to make my french toast blog for here... its on the to-do i
				promise)
				<br />
				we got up to a decent amount of shenanigans at the diner, laughing and
				carrying on and
				<u
					>making everyone put their phones in the middle of the table for "family
					dinner"</u
				>
				which was hilarious. i brought my digicam and my roomate took a ton of
				pictures (esp while everyone was eating so now my camera roll kinda looks
				like i'm a stalker -_-) it's weird to back to school now because we have to
				go thru the whole day still. <b>it really felt like a weekend!</b> at least
				fridays are a shorter schedule then the rest of the week (￣0￣)

				hi! genuinely forgot what i was gonna talk about today but i'm having a lot
				of fun watching
				<a

					title="youtube: the surprisingly deep lore of japanese phones by sakura stardust"
					>this video</a
				>
				as i write this! later today i'll need to work on college stuff but this is
				making me really interested in old tech designs, specifically flip phones,
				alllll over again. (♡⸃ ◡ ⸂♡) i think i'll genuinely start looking into
				getting my own in the near-ish future, maybe when i finish highschool. i
				just redownloaded instagram on tuesday (YES BAD IK) however after being
				offline for the most part since around the beginning of the year, i can now
				say this shit is <b>MID</b> and <b>BORING AS FUCK</b> and i don't really
				feel inclined to be on the app much. (green yuri editors are really cooking
				tho, i've been starved of edits on pinterest)
			</p>
			<p>
				long story short, i think the detox worked! o(≧∇≦o)
				<u>once i graduate i want to ditch my iphone</u> (sorry mom, you'll have to
				live with the green messages you loathe so much) and leave the social medias
				on my phone currently (insta, tumblr, and youtube) and use only their web
				versions so i can focus on immersing myself in the world around me.
				<b
					>even though my current phone usage in the social media area is pretty low,
					it can still be improved.</b
				>
				i spend a lot of time on my phone in discord talking to friends, reading
				manga saving pictures on pinterest, and spotify of course. which isn't
				terrible, but can be less, yk? i want to try and get some sort of flip phone
				(or the android flip cause its cute lol) for most of my daily usage. i'll
				likely keep the ipad tho, because procreate and toonsquid are genuinely so
				convenient and useful i don't want to leave them behind ヽ(`д´；)/ also i
				want to keep playing my periodic games of pjsk/bang girls dream band party
				(or whatever it's called), meow tower, piffle ball, and sky cotl lol
			</p>
			<p>
				now <u>HARD LEFT TURN</u> because i need to talk about the new sonic game.
				<b>sonic x shadow generations.</b> wonderful name, i know. good job sega.
				<i>JOKES ASIDE,</i> <b>i'm losing my fucking mind rn.</b> ━(((;ﾟДﾟ)))━ you
				mean to tell me there's an absolutely insane collectors edition of the game
				that comes with - most notably - physical copies of the artbook, the
				soundtrack on cd, a dreamcast jewel case, and
				<u><i>A SONIC AND SHADOW DREAMCAST STATUE????????????</i> (๑•̀ㅁ•́๑)✧</u> for
				the low, low price of <b>two hundred and fifty usd.</b> i think the worst
				part of this is i have more than enough money to my name to buy this
				currently, but idk if i can in good conscience (´；ω；`) i really want to
				buy it though omg. i can feel the judgement from "the powers that be" over
				my potential purchase of this item and genuinely with how i've been brought
				up as a person i don't think i can do it. which SUCKS SO BAD because I CAN
				AFFORD IT. (ʘ言ʘ╬) i made enough money at my job to buy multiple and
				<i>i'm not even going to buy one.</i> щ(ﾟДﾟщ)
				aughghguhdgflkiugholisujnhtrfliufd. maybe i'll get over it. who knows.
				<b>here's a picture of the collection for those curious:</b>

				okay as i am ignoring my college application responsibilities for the
				moment, i have time to write a real diary entry. yay! gonna try and use more
				kaomoji bc tbh importing the animal crossing emojis as i wrote was tedious
				and idk if i want to bring that back as my main system. i totally will for
				my animal crossing shrine but otherwise it's on the fence...
			</p>

			<p>
				we did a t-shirt painting event for seniors today and it was more fun than
				expected tbh. i did get fabric paint on my polo so that shit is NOT coming
				out lmao (ﾟωﾟ；) also i won a core value for kindness today. on one hand i
				do try my best to be very kind to everyone but on the other hand it's kind
				of silly to recieve the weekly title for it in front of the whole school.
				right before they announced the awards, i had thought to myself "they're not
				going to give them to seniors because we won't be at the morning meetings"
				and tuned out and then they announced my name T-T so i kinda just looked
				shocked while everyone else clapped... a bit embarrasing ಠ_ಠ
			</p>

			<p>
				as a whole, school is going okay so far. second week of senior year and
				we've done nothing more than sit through meetings in the auditorium all day
				(which feels <i>terrible</i> btw, tbh i'd rather sit in the classroom
				without the cushioned chairs so i can at least move around some...) so
				workload-wise it's not bad.
			</p>

			<p>
				college is a whole other subject though. i wouldn't say i want to go to
				college (because who dreams of work after all) but i need to make money and
				i need a degree to do that in cyber stuff. so off to college i go.
				applications are so annoying cause they ask me questions like i'm gonna get
				married to someone. <b>why do you need to know all this man!!!</b> (i do
				know why but the application process is so tedious, and i'm onlt doing
				common app rn) plus i am so cooked in the funds department :'D i'm certainly
				lucky to be where i am now bc i know i'm very well off thanks to my parents
				jobs, but i pretty much fall into the "parents make enough money to not
				qualify for fafsa but not enough to put three kids through college back to
				back" category. honestly, even if it was just me going to college i think
				the costs are most of a yearly income so it's still not really achievable.
				my test scores and grades should get me decent scholarships, but if i were
				to get into MIT or something i am <i>so done for</i>. last i checked that
				was ~70k USD a year and i don't even have an act score in their average
				range. everyone there is at a 35-36 and i'm at a 31 ヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ realistically i
				know that my score is fine and i can get into most schools i want to but tbh
				i can't help feeling a little dumb. plus a sizable amount of my friends made
				higher on their first take of the act
				<i><u>without even studying</u></i> and that's the result i get after 7+
				takes of the act. frustrating stuff!!
				<i>if only i was better at math... (;_;)</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				ignoring depressing college stuff, i can say that while i don't dream of
				work i <i>do</i> dream of my <u>perfect apartment life!!</u> of course i
				would rather have a house but in this economy? that shit is NOT looking
				promising lol. i do have dreams of great success and love and life and
				hopefully i can achieve them because if i don't that will cause some other
				problems (ﾟωﾟ；) if i'm being completely honest, my ideal life probably
				looks a lot like what's displayed on
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@annikasleaf">annika's vlog series</a>
				which i've been super into ever since i stumbled upon vlogging videos
				freshman year. i don't think i've really been into keeping up with a
				youtuber before her tbh, her videos just feel so calming to watch and even
				though many things are idealized online she does show everyday mishaps that
				make her videos just that much more entertaining and inspiring to watch lol.
				vlogs and baking videos have become a big part of my weekly routine because
				they're so calming and give me something to look forward to creating for my
				future! （*＾ワ＾*） honestly, if i was able to keep a nice apartment with
				someone i loved and work a job i didn't hate but still make enough to live
				comfortably off of with decent vacation options and things like that, i'd be
				set.
				<b>for some reason that feels like asking for a lot though... （ꐦ𝅒_𝅒）</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				might start making writing here a part of my nightly routine so i have at
				least some archive of my thoughts? but for now i need to get ready for bed
				so adios :)

				hi i don't actually have much time to write today, so this is kind of a
				placeholder thing bc i really need to go to sleep. may come back and school
				and stuff. we'll see. howdy to anyone reading this. idk i never say howdy.
				i'm going to go to sleep now -v-
