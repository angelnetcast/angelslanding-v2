		<h2>about the webmaster</h2>
		<p>
			hi! my name's angel. i use <mark>he/she</mark> pronouns and i'm
			<u>autistic</u>. i've been working on this site since 2022, and been into
			html since whenever i joined toyhou.se (fuck bootstrap though, it is my
			greatest enemy). i used scratch as a kid and that's how i got into coding,
			but lets be honest, i used that site to make animation memes 90% of the time.
			i <b>LOVE</b> to collect things like video game consoles, dvds, cds, and
			vinyl records. i also draw a lot of the time and make music less of the time,
			and make games none of the time (yet).
			<br />
			like many other neocities users, i'm not that big on social media and prefer
			a less centralized online space that focuses on user expression instead of
			company profit.

		<h2>about angel's landing</h2>
		<p>
			this is <u>version 1.5</u> of the site, featuring a very barebones look so i
			can focus on the content. as i'm writing this, i'm kind of getting attatched
			to the minimal look...
			<br />
			this is my most impressive personal project imo. i started coding because i
			love customization and i thought a site i made myself could be
			<i>waaaaaay</i> cooler than whatever i cook up within the carrd free plan
			limits. i have fun showing this off to other people (though maybe not in its
			current state...) but i also get a lot of fulfillment from just taking the
			time to learn how to do something new. if you're on the fence about getting
			into html, i'm telling you to go for it! there's a large network of people
			willing to help you get on your feet. plus its fun to have your own website,
			what else is there to know...
