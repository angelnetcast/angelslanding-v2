					<h1>bookshelf</h1>
					<p>
						i used to be an incredibly avid reader but gifted kid burnout so i don't
						read anymore. many such cases. hopefully this will encourage me to pick up
						more books. you can typically find me reading manga though.
						<br />
						if you have sci-fi recs <u>pretty pretty please</u> email me. i do really
						want to get back into reading. i love stories about robots, dystopian
						realities, and weird videogames that take over the human conciousness.
						basically things that talk about the effect a new technology has on the
						human world. i also like animal stories (think wings of fire, watership
						down, flora and ulysses, that type of thing.)
